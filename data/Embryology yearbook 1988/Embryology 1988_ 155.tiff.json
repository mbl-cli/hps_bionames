The quantitative determinations require\nthe reaction proceed to equilibrium in the presence of excess\nUnder these conditions, the protein distributes between the\ntwo DNA species as a function of its affinites for each. The\nproportion of each DNA fragment that is bound versus free is\ndirectly quantitated by densitometry or scintilation counting,\nyielding a measurment of relative affinity. Although not part\nof our lab excercise, it is important to note that the gel retar-\ndation assay can also be used to determine the fraction of\nprotein that is active for DNA binding, as well as its absolute\nequilibrium binding constant for a given DNA fragment (see\nauxiliary handouts).\nProcedure\n1)\nIn each of five eppendorf tubes, mix ul (10-llM) of the\ntwo labeled fragments to be tested.\nTo each tube add\npoly dI/dC).\n2)\nl7 ul of binding buffer(with lmg/ml\n3) Add protein (we will use the DNA-binding domain of the\nglucocorticoid receptor):\nprotein\nprotein\nprotein\nprotein\ntemperature for 5 min.\ntube -- no protein\ntube 2 -- 0.2 ng\ntube 3 -- 2 ng\ntube 4 -- 20 ng\ntube 5 -- 50 ng\n4) Incubate at room\n5) To each tube add\n2 ul of sample buffer and immediately\nlead onto a nondebturing polyacryamide gel\n\n"
