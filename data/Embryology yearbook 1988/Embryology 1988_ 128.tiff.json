A ventral furrow forms as a longitudinal cleft along the ventral\nmidline of embryo between 20 and 80% egg length. The cells immediately anterior\nand posterior to the furrow become thin. A posterior plate forms carrying pole cells\ntowards the dorsal side of the embryo. The cephalic furrow becomes apparent as an\noblique lateral infolding at two-thirds egg length. The dorsal cell layer is initially very\nthick and columnar at this stage. As the pole cells shift dorsally, the anterior and posterior\ndorsal folds begin to form.\n209\n\n"
