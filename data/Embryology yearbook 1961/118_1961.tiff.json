This is Tollowed by The second polar body aT 27 minuTes, The \"pear\nshaped sTage\" aT 46 minuTes, The polar lobe bulge, 52 minuTes; cleavage wiTh\npolar lobe aTTached, 58 mibuTes; cleavage compleTe wiTh polar lobe reserved\ninTo one blasTomere, 62 minuTes; and The 4-cell sTage 82 minuTes.\nNoTe during developmenT To The 2-cell sTage The changes in shape ThaT The egg\nundergoes. WhaT could These mean? Keep a few ChaeTopTerus larvae To observe\nTrochophore sTages. \nSPISULA SOLIDISSIMA\nSmall specimens of The surf-clam ?pisula.solidissimagcan be found locally and may\nbe maTure from laTe in May Through AugusT. The larger specimens more generally\nused come from The colder waTer on The norTh side of The Cape. For This reason,\nThere is some difficulTy in keeping These animals in good condiTion in The labora-\nTory. when placing These animals in The Tanks, iT is necessary To hold Them\neach under waTer for a few seconds wiTh siphons up To expell gas Trapped in\nTheir gill chambers; wiThouT This riTual, The animals sufficaTe.\nLarge numbers of gameTes can be obTained by breaking The shell near The umbo,\ncuTTing The adducTor muscles and removing The visceral mass and fooT inTacT. The\ngonad is exposed by Trimming The gills and cuTTing direcTly inTo The visceral mass.\nThe ovary or pieces of The ovary are placed in an made by cuTTing off\nThe boTTom of a plasTic cenTrifuge Tube (diameTer inch and fasTening a circle of\nbolTing cloTh To The inverTed lip by means of an elasTic band. FilTered sea waTer\nis Then poured over The ovary in The egg sTrainer and eggs pass Through The\nsTrainer inTo a beaker, leaving The ovarian Tissue and oTher debris behind. Eggs\nshould be allowed To seTTle in The beaker, and The supernaTanT should be decanTed.\nThis procedure should be repeaTed aT leasT Three Times. The use of a siphon for\nremoving The supernaTanT resulTs in less loss of eggs, alThough iT is a good idea\nTo lose some of The lighTesT eggs, as These are probably The leasT maTure.\nExcised TesTes should be cuT up and placed on a 5 inch square double layer of\ncheesecloTh which has previously been weT wiTh pyrex disTilled waTer and wrung dry.\nThe corners of The cheesecloTh are Then gaThered and TwisTed To press The seminal\nfluid ouT of The bag so formed and inTo a dry dish, This can be covered and kepT\nrefrigeraTed for aT leasT 24 hours and possibly longer. This \"dry\" sperm is diluTed\ndrop To IO ml. Tor The sTock suspension, and To 3 drops oT This is used To\ninseminaTe eggs in IO ml. of sea waTer, The quanTiTy of sperm varying wiTh The\nnumber of eggs and The purpose of The experimenT. Spisula eggs are very suscepTible\nTo polyspermy; The presence of more Than Two pronuclei aT abouT 50 minuTes afTer\ninseminaTion is a good criTerion of polyspermy. Spiscula eggs are also very\nsucepTib|e To crowded condiTions; These can lead To delayed or inhibiTed miTosis\n(see Allen, l952D.\nThe eggs of Spisula solidissima are in some respecfs similar To eggs of MacTra\nsTulTorum, which were described early in The cenTury by KosTanecki aT Naples.\nEarly workers aT Woods Hole called The local clam \"MacTra\", even Though The name\nSpisula had been given To iT in i838 by A True \"MacTra\" egg is available\nin Florida. The Woods Hole Spisula egg has been used in only a few major sTudies;\nSchechTor sTudied The aging responses in This egg, and more recenTly a sTudy of\nferTilizaTlon and arTificial acTivaTion was done by R. D. Allen.\nThe Spisula egg is abouT 56 microns in diameTer and quiTe Transparenf. \n\n",
