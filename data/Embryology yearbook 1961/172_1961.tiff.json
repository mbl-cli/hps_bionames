The pieces were\nThen squeezed Through bolfing cloTh inTo a fresh 50 ml. of cold and \nfree sea wafer, and The cells were filTered firsT Through a single layer of \nsfandard bolTing cloTh, Then Through a sieve made up of Three layers of bolTing\ncloTh. ln The case of boTh Microciona and Haliclona, The resulTing suspensions\nwere found To conTain befween aggregaTion, a ml. aliquoT of The suspension was diluTed wiTh 4 ml. of filfered\nsea waTer. AfTer reaggregafion had proceeded for a given lengTh of Time, The\naggregaTed maTerial was removed by pouring The suspension Through a sieve made of\n3 layers of bolTing cloTh inTo a cold cenTrifuge Tube conTaining 25mg. of\nsodium ciTraTe, which prevenTed furTher aggregafion.
