The following points will be considered:\nl. Morphology of the gametes.\n2. Maturation of the ovum.\n5. Fertilization\n4. Cleavage of the zygote.\n5. Gastrulation.\n6. Organogeny and metamorphosis.\nThis will be followed by several experimental studies.. A par~\ntial list of experiments suggested will be found below.\nln order that material of different stages be available at\nall times, the instructor in charge will place stock cultures of\'\ndifferent ages on the tables. Please he careful to avoid con-\ntaminating tmsse. This may be avoided by using only the pipette\nfound in each dish for securing material from that culture.\nlt is essential that material be conserved. This is especially\ntrue in the case of the starfish. Ripe individuals have gonads in\neach of the rays. One of the arms may, therefore, be removed and\nthe gametes which issue from the gonad may be made to serve a large\nnumber of students. When one arm is removed from an animal, that\nanimal should be placed in a special container in order that,\nshould it be a male; the sperm shall not infect females opened in\nthe same way. The same care in conservation should be used with\nEchinarachnius and Arbacia as well.\nEchinoderms are diocious, i.e. the sexes are separate. It is\nimpossible, however, to distinguish the male from the female by\nsuperficial examination. It is necessary to open animals until\nripe individuals of each sex are found. This should be done in the\nfollowing ways. A) starfish: Wash the animal and all instruments\nand hands in fresh tap~water to Kill any adhering spermatozoa. Now\nrinse well in running sea-water from the tap. One of the\narms should now be removed. With forceps remove the gonad which\nlies free in the cavity of the ray and place in a dish.without\nsea~water. The gonads of the males are white; those of the female\nare orange-yellow. The gametes will flow from the isolated gonad.\nFemale gonads should be placed immediately in a finger bowl con~\ntaining sea~water. The male gonads should be left in a watch \nin order that the sperm may be obtained \'dry\'. When eggs cease to\nflow from the female gonad, the fleshy part should be removed and\nthe ova washed several times in the following way. Add a considerable\namount of sea-water to the eggs and allow thenato settle. Now pour\noff the water and add a fresh supply. This does not remove very\nsmall fragments of the ovary but it does serve to eliminate a great\ndeal of the body fluid mrids may chance to be present. E(Echinarach-\nnius: Wash the animals as described above. Cut across the animal\nwith a heavy pair of scissors. The gonads will be exposed. Place\nthe males inya clean dry dish in order that \'dry\' sperm will be\navailable. Wash the eggs extruded from.the ovaries (which are\npurple in color) as described above for the starfish. sea~urchin:\nAfter washing the animals, puncture the soft tissue at the peristome\nwith a sharp pair of scissors and out around the equator exposing the\n\n'),(12,1,'Embryology 1939_19.tiff.','\ngonads. The sex glands of`the male are grayish white; those of the\nfemale are maroon-red. After rinsing out the contents of the cavity\nwith fresh sea-water, place the males upside down in a watch \nto allow the sperm to run out through the genital pore. This is\n*dry* sperm. Pick the ovaries out of the shell and place in a finger\nbowl full of sea-water. After approximately five minutes strain\nthrough cheese cloth and then wash the gametes as described above\nfor the starfish. The gametes are now ready to use in your observa-\ntions. All should be prepared fresh unless otherwise indicated.\nl. of the gametes. e. Q. Q.\nThe Ovum: Mount freshly shed eggs in a little sea~water and\nobserve the appearance of the egg. Are all the eggs of the same\nsize? Are they all in the same stage of development? Cad you see\nthe nucleus? Does the protoplasm of which the egg is composed\nappear homogeneous in all regions? Are there any cytoplasmic inclu>>\nsions? Can you see any pigment within the eggs? ls there more than\none hind? Is there any evidence of differentiated structure within\nthe cytoplasm? Do you see any polar bodies? How many? Do you see\nany evidence of jelly around the egg? New mount some eggs in a\nsmall amount of sea-water containing a heavy suspension of india ink.\nWhat structures are new visible that you did not see before? Look\nat a number of eggs and see if you can find the micropyle. This\nmay be seen as a conical depression in the jelly surrounding some\nof the eggs. ls the jelly coat always the same thickness? Make\ndrawings to illustrate the points observed and compare the different\neggs studied. Do mature eggs of the different forms differ in size?\nThe sperm: Place a very small amount of the dry sperm in a drop\nof sea-water on a slide. A sufficient number will be carried on the\nend of a pair of forceps dipped in the ?dry\' sperm preparation, Try\nto observe the form of the sperm and their motility. For the latter\'\ndetermination use sea-water with india ink suspension. A demonstra-\ntion of spemn under dark field illumination will be made.\n2. Nahiration of the ovum. Q. Q. Q.\nWhen shed under normal conditions, the eggs of all three of the\nanimals studied are ready for fertilization. When removed from the\novaries in the laboratory some of the ova are not mature. Examine\neggs from each of the forms. Those of the starfish are best for the\nstudy of the maturation process. Place some eggs from a freshly pre-\npared culture on a slide and note the condition of the nucleus in\nseveral. Select oocytes with.germinal vesicle intact and observe\nthem over a period of from one and one~half hours to two hours, Re~\ncord the changes observed by means of sketches. he sure the illumina\ntion employed is correct in order that you may trace the formation\nof the polar bodies, .Do you find any immature eggs in cultures from\nEchinarachnius and Arbacia? Sketch. When the eggs are mature they\nmay be fertilized.\n5. Fertilization. Q. Q.\nIn order to avoid pathological polyspermy in the eggs studied\na dilute sperm suspension should be used in making the inseminations.\nThis may be assured by the following method. Add one drop of *dry*\nsperm to 25 cc. of sea~water. To a mass of eggs in approximately\n50 occ. of sea-water. add 6 to 7 drops of this suspension. \"his con~\n\n'),(13,1,'Embryology 1939_2.tiff.','\n'),(14,1,'Embryology 1939_20.tiff.','\ncentration is sufficient to ensure fertilization of all of the\nmature ova in a good batch of eggs. As soon as the sperm are added\nthe water containing the eggs should be agitated in order that the\nsperm may be as nearly evenly distributed as possible. Place some\nof the eggs on a slide immedigtely after removal and observe the\nchanges which take place in the egg. Note the gross changes here.\nThe penetration of the sperm and the elevation of the membrane may\nbe better observed by another method of insemination.  Mount a few\nof the eggs in india ink and observe. Make sketches.\nThe activity of the spermatozoa and the rapidity with which the\nspent enters the egg and the accompanying changes take place varies\ndirectly with the temperature of the medium and hence the gemetes.\nFor this reason it is desirable to study these changes in prepara~\ntions which have been chilled to such an extent that it takes place\nslowly\" Make preparations as follows. Chill eggs and sperm in sea~\nwater by the use of an ice bath. Mount a few of the eggs on a slide\nunder a cover glass and add a little of the sperm suspension at one\nside. Observe constantly until the sperm appear in the field and\nthen watch carefully for the union of the sperm and the egg. How\ndoes this take place? Examine carefully the way in which the per-\nivitelline space is formed and the manner in which the membrane is\nelevated. How many sperm enter each egg?\nEggs should be fertilized each morning and each afternoon for\nseveral days in order that you may have cultures at different\nstages of development for use during the following periods.\nWhen you have prepared cultures as described above, place some\neggs in about 25 c.c. of sea-water and add a drop of dry sperm,\nstir vigorously and allow to stand for three minutes to settle.\nPour off the supernatant sea~water and wash to remove excess\nsperm. Set aside for examination at the time of the first cleavage.\nSuch eggs will show a high percentage of polyspermy.\nQ. Cleavage of the zygote. Q. Q.\nOne result of complete fertilization is cleavage of the zygote.\nExamine eggs of each of the above forms in your cultures and study\nthe morphology of cell division, the time at which each cleavage\ntakes place in each form, and pattern formed by the blastomeres.\nAre you able to determine the relation of the cleavage planes to\nthe polar orientation of the egg? Be sure to record the temperature\nof the sea-water in the culuires (vide seq.). Make sketches of\neach of the cleavage stages in each form and any other events i\nCJ\nwhich are of interest to you. How does the cleavage in the cul-\ntures inseminated with dilute sperm suspension compare with that\nin use cultures inseminated with dry sperm? Now compare the rate\nof cleavage in the three types of eggs. Are they the same? Gan\nyou think of any explanations for discrepancies which appear in\nyour data? The blastula is fonned within the first twelve hours.\nCompare the blastulae of the three At what stage is the\nvitelline membrane lost? When do embryos first become motil?

They do not survive well in the laboratory even in aquaria\nof running water. When removed to fingerbowls, the individuals are\napt to die unless kept below room temperature. When working\nwith the stems of hydroids, use few stems in large volumes of water,\nand change the water frequently. Do not crowd either the adult stems\nor the eggs and embryos. It is not\"g55d to spoil experiments lasting\nl2-24 hours by being careless about crowding the material.\nIn general it is advisable to select a goodsized colony, examine\nit under low power to find the gonads, and to clip off the branches\ncontaining the best material. These can be rinsed in running sea\nwater and further sorted and separated.\n\nThe ability of the hydrozoa to regenerate and to reproduce by\nbudding has been famous 200 years. iubularia is favorable material\nas an example because of its size and abundance. 1\nTemperature is a very important limiting factor to these animals.\nlney drop off their hydranths in midsummer when the water warms above\nQi degrees C, and remain dormant until the water cools, and then put\nout new ones (Moore Regeneration never takes place at tmepera~\ntures above 250 C. so the experimental material must be kept in finger~\nbowls in running sea water.\nQiafaie of T2E@n??3ti9Qri@ E?9Ximal 333 disiel ha1V@5~\nWith sharp scissors cut a number of individuals from the colony\nat their points of attachment, selecting those which measure 50 mm.\nvr so in length. From these, cut off the hydranths, each with a\nmillimeter of stem (to get rid of the base of the hydranth, which is\nsomewhat retarded in its regeneration). Take 20 beheaded stalks of\nuniform size and cut them each into equal halves, putting the distal\n(hydranth) halves in one fingerbowl of sea water and the proxima\nhalves in another. (Avoid pinching or damaging them in transfer .\nCover the fingerbowls and place them in the sink where they will be\nkept cool by the running sea water. Change the water several times a\nday.\nUsually l8-24 hours after cutting, the primordium of the oral and\nbasal tentacles can be seen thru the perisarc. Observe that the hy~\ndranth differenetiates in situ and not as an outgrowth. See the cir-\nculation in the stem. After 50 hours, take freqrnt observations and\nrecord the time of emergence of the new hydranths in both lots. After\n60 hours, compare the rates of regeneration of distal and proximal \nhalves. Any indication of an axial gradient of regeneration-rate?\n(Barth i\n\n'),(26,1,'Embryology 1939_31.tiff.',' -2- i\nBrelatioeass in the Stea-\nSelect SO uniform individuals of Tubularia, and cut off hydranth\nand a short piece of distal stem, as before. From the distal (hydranth)\nend of each stem cut a piece mm. long, takvng care not to confuse the\norientation of the pieces. Divide them into two lots of l5, A and B. \nFasten the pieces of the A lot wide their distal ends all on the same i\nside, in a fingerbowl of sea water. Ligate each of the lot pieces\nin the middle, by tying a thread firmly around it, and orient them\nsimilarly in a fingerbowl of sea water. Cover both fingerbowls and\nplace them in the sink to be kept cool. Change water regularly.\nCn the third day record the number of individuals in A which\nshow regeneration on their proximal ends, and the number which show\nregeneration distally. Do the same for the ligated lot individuals.\nEsmpared with the lot in which the two ends have been isolated by\nLigature, do the A lot show any indication of a dominance-suppression\nrelationship of the two ends? Which end is dominant? (Barth \'58)\n\nTHB, or nislicsnusi .\nThere are two phases of embryology in the Hydrozoa. Characteris~\npically, a long series of asexual reproductions, by budding and other\nmethods, is punctuated at irregular intervals by alternation with\nisolated examples of sexual reproduction. this alternation of genera- \ntion is closely paralleled by an alternation of form, since the pro-\nduction of zygotes is usually accomplished by medusae, and the pro~\nluqtion of buds by polyps. In some hydrozoa no medusa~form is known,\nin others no polyp-form is known, and there are all stages between.\nShe hydrozoa available at Woods hole illustrate well the variability in\nstructure of the medusa~state. ihe best example of a complete medusa\nwith a degenerate polyp stage is idealized jelly~fish Gonionemus,\nbut it is unfortunately now nearly extinct at Woods Hole. The genera\npicked for study are arranged in the order of diminishing completeness\nei\'the medusa form, the first having free~swimming medusae and the\nlast mere sporosacs. The utter degeneration of the medusa-form is\nillustrated by the familiar Hydra. \nBecause of seasonal variations and unpredictable fluctuations\nin the Coelenterate fauna, some of the material desoribed~may not be\navailable, and the order of study will have to be announced.\nheugainvillae (July and August)\nThe gdnophores are borne singly or in clusters on the main stem\nind branches. New buds destined to become medusae are scattered\nirregularly throughout the colony, there being no arrangement according\nto age. Examine buds that show successive stages of development, and\nfind out how a medusa is formed.\nWhen all of its parts except the sex organs are fully formed,\nthe medusa breaks loose mid swims away, living l~2 months. Its struc~\nture is diagrammatic. Find a well~developed specimen and identify its\nnmnubrium, radial and circular canals, velum, 4 groups of marginal\ntentacles and eyespots. These medusae gradually form eggs and sperm\nbut the embryos do not develop inside them.\n\n'),(27,1,'Embryology 1939_32.tiff.','-5-\nObclig.

These\nmature as medusae and break loose, escaping past the blastostyle\nplug thru the opening of the gonangium. Their free-swimming life\nlasts l-2 months. They are commonly caught in tow nets.\nSee if you can tell which of the gonophores on a blastostyle\nthe older. Determine the general structure and position of the\ntentacles on one of the older gonephores; \n9.196\nwith needles open the gonangium of a well-matured gonoseme and\nexamine the gonophores that are relaesed. If any are practically\nmature they may show swimming movements. Some that show earlier\nstages of development may be liberated by teasing and studied.\nIf Obelia colonies are kept overnight in a dish of sea water\non the desk (remember not to crowd them), mature swimming medusae can\nusually be found in it next day. Examine some of them when available\nand note that their structure is imperfect (compared with\nthat of Bougainvillea).\nThe velum is reduced to a narrow and somewhat lobed membrane\nnear the bases of the tentacles. This makes possible an eversion\nof the bell when the medusa comes to rest, so that the manubrium\nsticks out from the center of the convex side, like the handle of\na post~hurricane umbrella. Watch the swimming movements, and see\nhow this happens. ln the everted condition, the manubrium is still\nmorphologically sub~umbrella, though the term has lost its appro-\npriateness.\nThe medusa of Obelia geniculata has 24 tentacles when\nliberated, while that of Obelia commissuralis has 16. Beth forms\nmay be available in the laboratory. Neither has the gonads developed\nwhen liberated.\nTennaria. (July, \nGonephores bud off singly around lower portion of the\nhydranth. They form reduced medusae with rudimentary\ntuft-like tentacles. Before opening out as transparent bell-shaped\nforms they suggest cocoanuts. A single colony bears gonophores\nof one sex only, but in the living individuals, sex can bc diagnosed\nonly with difficulty until they mature, when the pinkness of eggs and\nthe whiteness of sperm appear.

The eggs reach the planula stage in one day.\nMature Pennaria colonies festooned with shedding medusae pro-\nvide an astonishing and beautiful spectacle that the student should\ncertainly see. \'Demonstration will be made at the proper season\n(usually mid-July).\nTease apart male and female gonophores and examine the eggs\nand spent.\nPut stems from ripe male and female colonies together in a\nfingerbowl at 5~4 having carefully rinsed them to protect\nagainst contamination, and leave them overnight.T Next day, remove\nthe stems and look for free~swimming medusae as evidence of shedding.\nlf they are found, look for developing eggs. The eggs are very\nsimple and ameboid, with no apparent membranes. Follow their develop-\nment as far as possible. If the water is changed at least once a\nday, the culture should yield stages in the very simple metamorphosis\nof the planula. (Hargitt, G. T. l900, l909).\nQonothyrea.\nLs in Obelia, the medusae develop within the gonangium. When\nmature they remain attached to the end of the blastostyle, outside\nthe gonangium for several days. Within the bell of the medusa the\neggs are fertilized and develop to the planula stage. Then they are\nset free and the medusa drops off. (Uulfert \nCampanularia. (June, July)\nlt is not safe to try to distinguish this genus from Obelia\nby the anatomy of the feeding individuals. Even the gonosomes are\nsimilar in appearance in the two genera, each consisting of a\ntransparent gonangium with blastostyle extending from base to tip\nand gonophores budding from it.\nThe striking difference is that in Cmnpanularia the medusae\nare not set free, nor do they even attain any characteristic medusa\nform, so far as can be seen in life. Each gonophore on the blastostyle\nof a female colcny contains a very large, irregularly shaped egg\nwhich is fertilized, cleaves, a morula, gastrulates by delamina-\ntion and reaches the free-swimming planula stage in situ. Then the\nplanula is released from the gonangium.\nSelect a gonosome showing eggs in the basal gonophores. Mount\nit on a slide and study with various magnifications under the\nmicroscope.\n\n'),(29,1,'Embryology 1939_34.tiff.','\nSelect and study another gonosome with planulae showing near\nthe tip. Squeeze or open the gonophore with needles and liberate\nthe planulae. Notice their ciliated ectoderm and watch their move-\nments.   \nSelect some gonosomes with very well matured planulae. The\nlatter should be two or three times longer than broad, and show\nmaggot~like movements inside the gonangium. Liberate such planulae\nwith needles and place them in watch glasses with sea water (not\nmore than 2 or 5 specimens to a watch glass). Qover them and set\naside for future examination.\nThe planulae should attach to the glass in 4 to 10 hours. Each\nshould open a mouth, had out tentacles, secrete hydrotheca and\nperisarc and become a fully fonned individual polyp in two or three\ndays.\nWhen the planulae have attached, the sea water should be\nchanged at least twice a day. From time to time as laboratory work\npermits, study the stages of development that unfold from the\nplanula.\nMale gonosomes are similar in form.to the female. The gono~\nphores when mature shed sperm, which become active upon coming in\ncontact with the sea water.\nQydractinia. (June, July)\n\nhe unusual colonies of this form are found growing on hermit\ncrabs or under rocks. They include nutritive individuals (ordinary\npolyps), long filiform defensive individuals with apical knobs of\nand gonosomes. These three types of individuals arise\nfrom an enerusting hydrorhiza anastomosis whiah is covered with a\nrust-red crust and often studded with spines.\nThe gonosomes are usually without tentacles and have a large\nknob of on the proboscis; each bears a number of gono-\nphores which are medusa-buds reduced to the status of sporosacs.\nMale and female colonies can be told apart if ripe, since the eggs\nwithin the sporesacs are dull green against the red hydrorhiza,\nand the sperm when.mature are white,\nHydractinia is handiest for study when growing on Littorina\nshells inhabited by the small hermit crab Pagurus. Select a shell\nbearing a ripe male colony and one bearing a ripe female colony,\nand put that together in a fingerbowl of sea water. After 48 hours\nlook for developing eggs, embryos and swimming and attached planulae\nin the dish. Isolate some in watch glasses of sea water for study\nof the further development. (Beckwith lQld).\nEggs are heavily yolky and green, and the cleavage is quite\nirregular, there being frequent ameboid changes in shape. Gastru~\nlation starts at the l6-cell stage by mixed delamination and multi-\npolar proliferation.\n\n'),(30,1,'Embryology 1939_35.tiff.','\nBy elongation andithe acquisition of cilia, a planula is pro-\nduced. It swims heavify but rolls and crawls actively on the bottom\nlike a planarian. httaehing hy its small hind end, it produces a\nsuccession of tentacles, and actively sends out numerous anastomosing\nencrusting hydrorhiza processes, from which sprout new individuals.\nObserve specimens that have been growing several days or a week.\nRemove several male reproductive individuals showing ripe\nsporosacs, and crush them under a coverslip on a glass\nslide. This may be done by drawing off some of the water with\nblotting paper. The sporosacs fall far short of being perfect\nmedusae. Note stages in the production of sperm within them. Burst\na mature sporosac and study the sperm under high power.\nSimilarly crush several female reproductive individuals, and\nobserve the eggs with their large germinal vesicles, in various\nstages of development. (Bunting \nTubularia (June, July)\nThe gonosomes of a well~matured specimen form long racemes or\nclusters of gonophores crowding and drooping from the region between\nthe two circles of tentacles on a hydranth. The gonophores are quite\nseverely reduced medusae which never become free-swimming, usually \nhave no evident radial or circular canals and develop nothing but\nbuds for tentacles, Wits rare exceptions male and female gonophores\noccur in separate colonies, male colonies being a very small minor-\nity. Diagnosis of se; by sight is impossible in the immature, but\ngonophores that contain embryos are easy to poll from those that\nare filled with a cloudy mass of sperm.\nExamine a male gonophore, considering it as a very degenerate\nmedusa. Notice its mode of attachment, its shape, the structure of\nits free end and the position of the sperm surrounding the dark rod\nmanubrium. Crush a ripe male gonophore on a slide and inspect the\nmotile sperm under high power.\nExamine a female gonophore. Usually the tentacles at its distal\nond appear only as four short blunt knobs, but one or more of them\nare sometimes elongated. The eggs come from favored oocytes\nthat progressively swallow up their neighbors, lying in the space\naround the manubrium.\nWhen ripe the egg is very large and somewhat ameboid. (Allen\nl900). mAfter fertilization a coeloblastula is formed. Gastrulation\nhas been described (Benoit \'25) as a mixture of delamination and\nmultipolar proliferation. The embryos are developed up to the\nactinula\" stage within the gonophore. The actinula is to be con-\nsidered as a precociously metamorphosing form, part planula and part\npolyp.  \nOpen some female genophores and study the larvae thus liberated.\nThe younger ones are flattened, with blunt marginal processes. it\nfirst these are not symmetrical in outline, but radial symmetry is\nattained later. when the larva has reached the actinula stage it\nhas a mouth and tentacles, and a rounded aboral body that later be~\ncmnes attached.\n\n'),(31,1,'Embryology 1939_36.tiff.','|071\nPlace a few actinulae in watch glasses with sea water, and\nexamine them two or three times a day. They will not develop much\nfurther without feeding, which is difficult and will not be attempted\nSertularia.\nThe gonangium is large, oval and sessile, stouter in female\ncolonies than in males. It contains a blastostyle which does not\nform free medusae but produces eggs or sperm more directly. The\neggs are fertilized in situ and gastrulate daru a secondary morular\ndelamination, forming planulae which have enough musculature for\nmovements. Embryos and planulae in various stages are often\nfound in apical swellings of the blastostyle called which\nact as brood pouches.\nIn sertularia it has been reported that the primary polyp forms\nfrom the side, shifting the organism\'s polarity 90 degrees. The\noriginal planula becomes the hydrorhiza.\nEudendrium. (July, August)\nThe gonosomes of the two sexes are strikingly different. Those\nof the female consist of loose irregular tufts of sporosacs (degenerw\nate, sessile medusa~forms or gonophores)mattached to the stem, each\nsporosac being bright orange in color. ihe male sporosacs are light\npink and are found in groups of four or more which radiate off from\nme nyarantn like spokes of a wheel. ine outermest, repeat male\nsporosacs are white with spenn.\nThe eggs are fertilized within the female gonophore (sporosac)\nand develop to the planula stage before being liberated. (Hargitt,C.\nW. l904). Tease out embryos from different colonies and study all\nstages found. The eggs are so rich in yolk that they cleave like\ninsect eggs. Gastrulation is by an extraordinary delamina~\ntion. Metamorphosis is simple.\nDEVELOEMENT GF \nGrease 01?   \nBoth these jellyfishes have oral lobes extending downward. In\nmature specimens granular material will be found entangled on the\nlobes. Tease off some of this material into a drop of sea water on\na slide, and examine under the microscope. Most of the particles\nare masses of embryos, and must be further teased apart with needles.\nLt different points on the oral lobes embryos of different stages can\nbe found, from spherical cleaving eggs to oval gastrulating forms and\nfully fermed stocky, active planulae.

Because these developmental\nforms must be constantly related to the structure of larvae and\nadults, it is necessary that the student should first of all re-\nview in a standard text the anatomy and life history of the common\ntypes of tunicates,\nA. SIMPLE ASCIDIANS\nDEVELUPMENT T0 THE TADFOLE STAGE.\nStyela. (Old name \nSince the publication of Conklin\'s description of the develop~\nment of Styela eggs (l905), these have been a classic example of\nthe determination of embryonic organs and tissues in the?undivided\negg following fertilization. With certain concessions to recent\nexperiments, Styela is still one of the best cases of \"mosaic\ndevelopment\". Refer to Conklin\'s figures while observing the\n\na) Methods.\nThough truly hermaphroditic, Styela is ordinarily self-sterile\nlike several other ascidians. It sheds its eggs and sperm early\nin the evening, and fertilization takes place when gametes from\ndifferent individuals get mixed in the same region er dish. It is\neasy to have eggs shed and fertilized on normal schedule in the\nlaboratory, but it is a great disadvantage to have to study the\nmigrations of yellow pigment within them by artificial light.\nTherefor, it has been customary to open a number of large\nindividuals, remove theiigbright orange gonads and mince these up\ntogether in a dish, afterward filling the dish with sea water,\nstirring, and.removing the coarse debris from the center with a\npipette. Eggs, oocytes, oogonia and all developmental stages of\nsperm are left floating in the water. Whatever time the eggs present will be capable of fertilization, and\nwill begin development within the next few minutes. \nRecently, S. N. Rose has found that shedding of normal ripe\neggs and spermf can be induced at any time of day by controlling\nlight. His method is to select a number of large healthy individ-\nuals and to put them under a strong electric light watt\nbulb) in a dish of running sea water, the action of the light\napparently inhibiting maturatien and shedding. Them, depending\non when material is needed, the animals are put in the dark. At\nany time after early evening they respond to this by shedding\ntheir gametes within an hour or so.\nFnrtilized eggs may then be collected from,a dish.that has\ncontained several individuals, or ripe eggs and sperm from a dish\ndontaining a single individual. Timed fertilization can be accom~\nplished simply by mixing the gametes from two isolated individuals,\n\n'),(39,1,'Embryology 1939_43.tiff.','\nb) Mature Unfertilized Egg.\nThe mature unfertilized egg should show the following:\n(ll Chorion, a tough membrane with perhaps a few follicle cells\nadhering to its surface.\n(6 Small spherical test cells between chorion and the egg\nitself. \n5) reripheral layer of egg, a clear layer containing minute\nyellow granules.\n(4) Central part, consisting of gray yolk material.\n(5) Germinal vesicle, a very large eccentrically placed mass.\n\n1|\n\nc) Post-tertilization Rearrangements..\nCarefully watch for the rearrangement of egg substances starting\nwithin 2-8 minutes after fertilization. The clear yellowish peri~\npheral matter streams to the lower pole over the yolk, followed by\nthe clear protoplasm from the animal pole. If the yellow pigment\nis not visible, try a more colored egg. Use only daylight\nfor illumination, and have the diaphragm on une microscope wide open.\nRoll the egg around by moving the cover slip with a needle.\nThe gray yolk rises to occupy the upper pole, all except the\nspace that surrounds the maturation~spindle complex. Soon the yellow\nSubstance accumulates on one part of the lower hemisphere, where it\nassumes crescentic fern. Immediately above the broad part of the\nyellow crescent is a layer formed by the clear, cytoplasm.\nThe most remarkable characteristic of Styela is that now at the\nconclusion of these movements the position of the future larva is\nvisibly marked on die rsurface of the uncleaved egg. The broadest\npart of the yellow crescent is at the posterior pole, and the horns\nwrap around the right and left] sides. The animal pole, where the\nperminal vesicle lay, becomes the ventral~anterior side of the larva.\n-he vegetal pole, where the spermatozoon entered, is the future\ndorsal side, To avoid confusion, fix firmly in your mind the rela-\ntionship between egg orientation and definite axis of embryo.\nd) Cleavage.\nThe following approximate time schedule for the embryology of\nStyela is from the great monograph of Conklin \nFirst cleavage to 2 cells after 40 minutesVen fll2 so \nsen \"els so \nTo neural plate stage, 2 more hours.\nFully formed tadpole l2 hours after fertilization.\nFirst cleavage. Equal, separating Une two horns of the yellow\ncrescent from each other, likewise bisecting the clear proto-\nplasm anterior to the yellow.\n\n'),(40,1,'Embryology 1939_44.tiff.','(2)\n(5)\n(J)\n(5)\n\nSecond wcleavage. Nearly equal, vertical, at right angles to the\nfirst. The two posterior cells (B5 on the left and QQ on\nthe right) contain little yolk and practically all the\nyellow crescent substance. The two anterior cells (AE on\nthe left and QQ on the right) contain much yolk, and prac-\ntically none of the yellow crescent substance. The clear\nprotoplasm goes equally to the four cells.\nThird cleavage. Horisontal, the upper quadrant (cells aa, \nbe and bg) somewhat smaller than the lower quadrant (cells\nQQ, A4, and B4). The yellow crescent substance is al~\nmost entirely confined to the two posterior dorsal cells\n(sa, sa).\nFourth cleavage. The planes of cleavage vary in different quad~\nrants, but the new cells do not overlap the sagittal plane\nof the embryo. Two of the antero>>dorsal cells and two of\nthe posters-ventral cells of the l6~cell embryo are erowded\naway from this sagittal plane, but all other cells touch\nit. The dorsal and ventral hemispheres at this stage are \nmirror images. ihe yellow pigment lies in four posterior\ncells (B5.l, B5.2, B5.l and E5.2).\nFifth cleavage. Cleavage in the dorsal (vegetal) hemisphere\nprecedes that in the ventral (animal) hemisphere, and\ncleavage in the anterior part of each hemisphere precedes\nthat in the posterior part.\nAt the 32-cell stage, the yellow substance is almost\nentirely confined to six dorso~posterior cells, three on\neach side of the midline (B6.2, B6.5, 36.4, B6.2, B6.5,\nB6.4). They give rise to mesoderm and \nSix yolk-filled cells at the vegetal (definitive dorso~\nposterior) pole anterior to the yellow mesoderm cells, will\ngive rise to endoderm: A6.l, A6.5, B6.l, a6.l, 36.1.\nFour cells at the anterior border of the embryo just\nbelow the equator (A6.2, A6.4, A6.2 and A6.4), and two\njust above the equator (a6.5 and a6.5) will give rise to\nthe notocord and neural plate. \nill the rest of the cells are ectodermal.\n(6) Later cleavages, gastrulation, neurulation. The gastrula passes\nthrough disc-shaped, saucer-shaped and cup-shaped stages,\nstarting with the 7th cleavage. As it finally becomes\negg-shaped, the gastrula\'s blastopore, found at the shall\nhind end, becomes T-shaped, the stem of the bordered by\nthe yellow cells.\nThe cells overhanging the crossbar of the T~shaped\nblastopore constitute its dorsal lip. They it,\nfinally engulfing the yellow cells which from then on are\nonly seen dimly through the translucent ectoderm.\nWatch the gradual elongation of the embryo and the\nappearance of definitive tadpole fonn.\n\n'),(41,1,'Embryology 1939_45.tiff.','\nMolaula.\nThe eggs of Molgula follow almost exactly the pattern of\ndevelopment seen in Styela, but they do not have pigment. The\nanimals are self-fertile, A few fertvlized eggs may be obtained\nat any time by mincing the gonads in sea water, although spawning\nnormally occurs at daybreah. \nRose\'s method for controlling the spawning of Molgula or\nCiona is to put a few individuals in a large dish of sea water and\nstore them in the dark, for instance in a desk drawer, until eggs\nare needed. Molgula will shed lb minutes or so after being brought\nout into the light, Ciona immediately.\nStart some Molgula eggs developing, and follow the cleavage\nthrough gastrulation. If developing eggs are isolated in a watch\nglass, tadpoles and young stages of metamorphosis are obtainable.\nTadpoles are fully formed in 8 hrs. (Conklin \'O5a) (Grave \nE.

This permits maine\ntaining the\neggs in a considerable volume of water in a Syracuse\ndish so that concentration of the sea water by evaporation is not\nrapid. The\nphenomena can be readily seen with this magnification,\nwhich affords excellent definition. Higher power will be useful\nif it is desired to observe spennatozoa in detail under a coverslip.\nCare must always be taken to avoid inseminating heavily.

The polyspermic eggs of Nereis, how-\never, usually fail to cleave.\nIt will aid observation and study to sketch the egg before\nfertilization and at stages during and after fertilization.

The time schedule\nin the descriptive text below will hold approximately if the air\ntemperature\nof die laboratory is about 24 C.\nIf possible, arrange to observe two or more eggs which are\ntouching immediately after fertilization. 2-5 minutes after fer~\ntilization they will begin to be pushed apart by transparent jelly\nsecreted by theeggs. By EO minutes, the zone of jelly around each\negg will be as wide as the egg diameter.

After the polar body forms, the egg\nagain rounds up (16-19 minutes), but it elongates again in the\nsame manner to form the End polar body at perhaps 35 minutes. The\n2nd polar body often forms under the first, which is thus pushed\naway from the surface of the egg. The egg again rounds up \nminutes). The egg pronucleus may now sometimes be seen migrating\ntoward the center of the egg, and occasionally the sgemn pronucleus\nmay also be detected. By 55 minutes, the clear zone has extended\nfrom the polar region toward the equator of die egg, and at 57-40\nminutes a typical \"pear shaped\" stage is reached.

The adults are about half an inch\nlong and are very abundant in such saline bodies as the Great Salt\nLake (Utah) (7 to ll times as salty as the sea), Mono Lake (Calif.),\netc. They also occur in abundance in salterns in.which sea water\nis evaporated in the sun to manufacture salt, as on the margins\nof San Francisco Bay, where Use used in the laboratory were\nobtained.\nArtemis develop and live well in sea water, but they are rarely\nfound in the sea in nature, probably because they are defenseless\nand are eaten. Their tolerance for salt is so great that they can\nthrive in strong brines in which they have no enemies.\nThe or \"eggs\" as they are sometimes called, are pro-\nduced in great numbers at certain seasons and float on the brine\nso that they may be blown in windrows on the shore by wind. These\nare actually nauplii in a dried and resting condition within\nthe original egg shell. They keep for years. When placed in a\nsuitable medium, such as sea water, they absorb water and hatch\nin QU-45 hours, depending on temperature, etc.\nExamine some of the dried under the microscope.

Strip eggs into a clean bowl which has been moistened by sea\nwater. Strip milt and mix with eggs with barely sufficient salt\nwater to cover the eggs. Eggs should not be allowed to stand more\nthan five minutes before fertilizing. Pfter ten minutes add and\nchange sea water and leave in shallow water (not more than l/4 inch\ndeep). Keep bowl covered with glass plate. Do not at any time\nallow eggs to clump or accumulate in one spot. Label each lot with\nexact time of fertilization;\" Change water\'?t least once a day.\nb. The eggs should first be studied in condition in which they are\nspawned but for many purposes it is desirable to prepare the egg as\nfollows for microscopic study: remove the egg to a piece of filter\npaper until the jelly and outer fibres are removed leaving the sur-\nface of the outer membrane smooth and clean. Place in sea water\nin culture slide in which the depth of the depression is \nless than the diameter of the egg. ,(These are provided in the \nLaboratory equipment.)

Another method is to mount on an ordinary glass slide\nin sea water under a thin flexible piece of mica peeled from the\nthicker mica sheets that are provided.

Cleanliness: Use only dishes ThaT are biologically clean. Avoid using bi-\nchromaTe cleaning soluTion unless followed by prolonged rinsing. DeTergenTs are\ngood ferTilizaTion inhibiTors; rinse dishes carefully and lay Them upside down on.\nTowels. PipeTTes used for eggs and sperm should be rinsed immediaTely in sea\nwaTer To avoid encrusTaTion of dried gameTes.\n2. Avoid gverlnseminaTion: Remember ThaT very few spermaTozoa are required To\nbring abouT ferTilizaTion. If The egg suspension becomes noficeably more milky\nafTer inseminaTion, you have added Too much sperm; EiTher use a TooThpick To\ninTroduce sperm, or measure amounf as described under secTion on echinoderms.\nLabel sperm pipeTTe and use only Tor ThaT purpose.\n3. Keep TemperaTure low: Remember ThaT marine animals are accusTomed To Tempera-\nTures 5 To I5 degrees C. below room Temperafure. Never leave sTock culTures aT\nroom TemperaTure; They may noT develop normally. Remember ThaT eggs which normally\ndevelop, for example, aT may be heaT killed aT |501\n4. Qvercrowding: Remember again ThaT eggs spawned under naTural condifions\nprobably never have To face overcrowded condiTions. Avoid This very common source\nof abnormal developmenT by placing so few eggs in a single culTure ThaT They can\nhardly be seen. lf They form anyThing like a conTinuous layer on The boTTom of\nThe dish, They are Too numerous.

The early larva is\na sphere of cells, composes anteriorly of small columnar, flagellated loco-\nmotor cells and posteriorly ef large, granular cells. In later stages the\nlarva flattens cut, the large pesterier cells proliferate rapidly and pro-\ngressively envelep the small anterior cells. The process is reminiscent of\nepibolic gastrulatien. In the final conditien, the flagellateu cells form\nan inner lining layer in the gastrula-like larva (which for this reason is often\ncalled \"pseudcgastrula\").\n\n  \nv. - .f \n-l 5 qt\n\n,aff The free~swimming larva stays in surface waters fer abeut a day, then descends\nand attaches to a substratum at the anterior pole.

All other adult cell types sifferentiate\nfrom the cuter granular cells, some ef which migrate inward and settle among\nthe chcanecytes. After several days an osculum breaks through opposite the\narea of attachment, and lateral canals differentiate slowly.\nThe Amphiblastula is probably not an ancestral forerunner of the true\ngastrula of higher invertebrates; rather, parallel evolution is innicated.\nLARVQE\nPLAHULA\nThis is the basis larval type of all ccelenterates, even though, in several\ncases, the plannla phase is abridged and aces not represent a free-swimming\nphase Hvara, Tubularia)\nThe free-swimming planula is a 2-layered cvuid, with an ectederm of ciliated,\ncolumnar cells.

It creeps\nalong the bottcn fur scne tins, eral end duwn.

In all other\norders development is direct. Moreover, the direct developers start from\n\"ectolecithal\" eggs, they do not possess yolk inside them but are\nsurrounded by yolky nurse cells inside the egg shell. Thus the food supply is\nrelatively large, and development can be direct. On the other hand, the polyclads\nhave \"endolecithal\" eggs, where (some) yolk is within the egg cytoplasm. Here\ndevelopment includes a free-swimming larval phase, the so-called Mu1ler\'s larva.\nThis larva could well have been derived from a planula. A third germ layer\nis represented by cells between ectoderm and endoderm. As in\ncoelenterates, a single gastral opening forms in Muller\'s larva and this opening\ncomes to be situated ventrally. It is surrounded by a fold of tissue, which will\ncontribute to the formation of an eversible pharynx in the adult. The gastral\nopening leads into the gastral cavity, which in older larvae becomes branched\nincreasingly, foreshadowing the adult condition. Externally, 2 to 12 spots\n(depending on the age of the larva) are situated anteriorly .\'puThe most characteristic feature of Muller\'s larva is the presence of 8\npreoral ectodermal folds or arms, their margins lined with a continuous ciliated\nband, (in the diagram, the lobe is not shown -- it is situated dorsally)\nThese folds serve a function.\nMetamorphosis is gradual, involving a resorption of the ciliated folds and\na lengthening and flattening of the larva.\nIn certain features, Muller\'s la va resembles both the Pilidium of the\nnemertines and the Trochophore of annelids. as an exercise in speculative biology\ntry to estimate which of these resemblanoes might be fortuitous, indica~\ntive of parallel evolution, indicative of close ancestral relationships.\n\n'),(191,2,'153_1961.tiff.','-7.\nLARVAQ\nPILIDIUM\nIn most proboscis worms development is direct. Two families of the\nHeteronemertini feature a larval phase, the Piliuium. This larva may either he\nfree~swimming and planktonic (ggrehratglug), or modified for creeping, hence\nwithout locomotor appendages (Lineus; \"Desor\'s larva\").\nThe larva is helmet-shaped and the margin of the base is drawn out into two\ncharacteristic lappets, The entire margin of the base carries a ciliated hand,\nthe protctroch. A tuft of long cilia arises from an apical sensory plate. ln\nearly larvae, two ectodermal cells migrate into the blastocoele and give rise to\nloose A wide mouth forms at the base of the larva, between the\nlappets. It leads into a blind-ended gastral cavity. (Note that the larva still,\nfeatures the 2-way alimentary system cf coelenterates and flatworms, while the\nadult nemertean possesses a onequay system, with mouth and separate anus).\n\ne\' \nf\'\ndashed: asophagus, stomach\n s   amnivn\na       adult esfvfisrm\nfl*mins-px, i I  f \niff.; -   ., A. \n4 ..-J     \nl`   I:   na- wiltMetamorphosis is remarkable and complicated. Five ectodermal invaginations\n(their deep parts representing \"imaginal discs\") sink belsw the surface and even~\ntually fuse one with the other, closing off a double-walled cavity deep within\nthe larva. The outer wall is larval tissue, the so-called \"amnion\". The inner\nwall is formed from the tissue of the imaginal discs, and this is the ectoderm of\nthe future adult. The adult mesoderm is represented by cells which have\ncome to be included within the cavity, And the adult endoderm is the larval\nstomach, around which the amniotic chamber is formed. When the adult worm has\nmatured it breaks out of the amnion, and the pilidium, having lost its stomach\nand unable to nourish itself, soon dies.\nIn its mesoderm and its alimentary system, the Pilidium resembles Mul1er\'s\nlarva. The main evolutionary advance of the nemertines was apparently made in the\nadult, not in the larva, and the resemblance of the two larval types could indicate\nancestral relationship. On the other hand, both larval types also resemble the\nTrochophore in ectodermal ciliation, and this could well be a matter of parallel\nevolution\n\n'),(192,2,'154_1961.tiff.','\n7*\n\nTHE TROCHOPHORE \ni\nThis most ubiquitous of invertebrate larvae is characteristic of Annelius,\nMolluscs, Ectoproets, Enuoproots, and Brachiepods. It is possible that the\ntroehophore was invented only once, but it is equally possible that it evolved\nseveral times independently. Given the requirement of ciliary locomotion in sur-\nface waters, of an alimentary system with mouth and anus, and of triploblastic\norigin, then a trochophore-like organism is the simplest answer and a virtual\nnecessity, at least as a transient stage.\n-1\n,nfs\n\'liar.\n.v\n\n-I \n\nurnThe larva carries an apical tuft of long eilia on an anterior sensory plate,\na preoral oiliated band, the prototrooh, and in many troohophores a postural\nmetatroch is also present, together with a telotrosh, a posterior eiliary tuft.\nInternally, in addition to a oomplete alimentary canal, there is an aruhinephri-\ndium, running diagonally from the mouth region to the anus region.\nThe trochophore arises from the gastrula by increased relative proliferation\nof dorsal posterior sells (descendants of Bd), which shifts the blastophore from\nthe vegetative pole ventrally, to the mouth position. In some cases the blaste-\npore becomes oval, oonstriets in the middle, and so gives rise tu both mouth and\nanus. Otherwise a proetodaeum breaks through independently. Alongside the in-\ntestine are the mesoblast cells, descendants of Ad, the larval mesoderm.\nIn ?npglig?, the troohophore gradually metamorohoses by posterior longitudinal\nproliferation, and subsequent segmentation, of the posterior ectoderm, the meso-\nblests, and the intestine, and by transformation uf the remainder of the larva into\nthe adult head.\nIn holluses, the trochophore transforms into another larva, the VELIGER, which\nmetamorphoses into the adult later. The Veliger is characterized principally by\nthree structures: the velum, a ciliated flap developed from the pretotroch and\nserving as loeomotor organ; the shell gland, differentiated from the dorsal post-\nprototroohal eetoaerm, which forms the mantle and shell of the adult; and the\nanlage of the adult foot, originally an actodermal thickening just behind the\nmouth of the troohophore, later backed increasingly by proliferating mesenehyme,\nIn the metamorphosing Veliger, the velu  is sloughed off and anterior larval\ntissues disintegrate, Su that the mouth and the mergent foot are drawn relatively\nforward, The shell by this time is typical of a given mollusean class.\n\n'),(193,2,'155_1961.tiff.','CRUOTACEAU LARVAE \nThe development of certain decepoc crustaceans inoluoes the following series\nof sequential larval stages\nNAUPLIUS PROTOZOAEA MYSIS (ADJLT) \nThis sequence may be regaruec as the basic larvil seiies for Cru tacea as a whole\nbut only in relatively few species is the entire series plicit\nHatohing may occur at any of the abcve stages, in Qifferent species In\nune extreme the egg is shea, ans such forms are truly ovipaxcus In the other\nextreme, small auults hatch viviparuusly I\n2 Abridged cevelupment may occur either befcre or after hatching If hatch~\ning occurs at the Protozoaea stage, for example, some or all of the preceuing\nstages may be indistinet, may be abbreviated in various ways, and some may be\nskipped altogether.

The egg of Fundulus is a\ndemersal, or non-pelagic egg.\nlf available, The eggs of The cunner or chogseT (Taujoqolabrus adapersus) will be\nsfudied as an example of The pelagic egg Type.\nSince Fundulus eggs are in beTTer condiTion and more abundanf during June and The\nearly parT of July, iT is a good plan To commence experimenTs wiTh Them as soon as\npossible. Culfures of Fundulus of various ages will be available on The cenfral\nwafer Table af all Times.\nl.

The sexes of bofh species of Fundulus are easily idenfified.\nThe mafure female, E. heTerocliTusi is pale olive in color and usually possesses\nno disTincT bars or spofs, alThough The youn females have indisTincT, dark, Trans-\nverse bars on The sides. The dorsal fin is non-pigmenTed. The adulT male of This\nspecies is a dull, dark-green, The sides bearing narrow, ill-defined Transverse\nbars composed of silvery spofs. Thedorsal fin possesses black pigmenT arranged\nin a moTTled paTTern. The bodymarkings of E. maialis are more conspicuous. The\npale olive female has a paTTern of heavy black longiTudinal sTripes on The sides\nand a non~pigmenTed dorsal fin. The sides of The darker male bear a dozen\nbroad, dark, Transverse bars.

The inner\nfollicle cells also move similarly Through  he perivifalline space. While The\ncorTica| pigmenT becomes concenTraTed in a vegeTal cap, The gray yolk rises Toward\nThe animal pole. The sperm nucleus migraTes up The periphery of The egg To a\npoinT jusT below The equaTor, Then moves inward Toward The cenTer of The egg\nwhere iT joins The female pronucleus. The yellow pigmenT Tends To follow The\nsperm Toward The equaTor and soon assumes The form of a broad crescenT. As soon as\nThis sfage is reached, The Three major axes (anTero-posTerior, dorso-venfral, and\nrighT-lefT) of The fuTure larva can be deTermined. The cenTer of The yellow\ncrescenT marks The posTerior pole, and The arms of The crescenT wrap around The\nrighT and lefT sides.

Eggs are usually spawnec from 8-ll P.U. Few, if any, individuals\nspawn during the first night in the laboratory. To obtain eggs and sperm remove\n30 to 40 individuals from their shells and place them in sea water in a large\nfinger bow1? Keep aerated sea water running through the bowl auring the day.\nIn the late PM wash the animals ann dish free of sediment and leave the dish\nundisturbed on a table. Animals may begin to spawn at about 8 PM or thereafter\nand may continue for an hour or so.\n2 - \nThe The spherical egg measures from 180 to l9O micra in\ndiameter and appears opaque due to the large amount of yolk, Although internal\nprocesses can not be seen in living eggs, sections show that the ovum is usually\nin the process of developing the first maturation spindle when it is shed.\nSurrounding the egg is a tough, bristly ghorign, when the eggs emerge from the\noviduot they are embedded in a viscid jelly-like secretion which spreads over the\nbottom of the dish in a thin film,\n3. ?ertilization anu Clgavaggr There are no visible changes at the time of\nfertilization; a fertilization membrane is not raised and the egg does not change\nshape. Two transparent oolgr bodies are given off but no polar lobes are formed.\nThe first noticeable change occurs shortly before first cleavage when there is a\nslight flattening of the egg at the animal pole. The first cleavgge furrow\n(l hr. 40 mins. to hr. 50 mins. after insemination) divides the egg, in most\ncases, into equal blastomeres. In a small percentage of cases, one blastomere\nis perceptibly larger, The second cleavage is at right angles to the first, and\nagain in some cases the cell is larger. The cells of the figgt\nguartette of micromeres given off by the dexiotronic thigQ glegvage are distinv\nguishable from the larger mgcromeres. The further divisions follow the regular\npattern of spiral cleavage. Four quartettes of micromeres are given off. The\nfirst three give rise to the ectoderm, nervous system, and stomadeum, while the\nfourth quartette (except for the Ld cell) becomes part of the endoderm along with\nthe macromeres. The Ld cell gives rise to the mesoderm as well as endoderm.\nA. lime Table of The following record, procured from a batch of\neggs developing at is offered as a rough outline of developmental rate.\nMetamorphosis seemed tu occur early in this batch, the usual time being from\n7-12 days.

The following method is suggested:\nA. Obtaining with a heavy knife, loosen a Erepiuula shell from its\nattachment. The egg capsules will either be attached to the substrate or to the\nfoot of the female. Those that are small and light yellow contain eggs in the\nearlier stages of development; the larger, deep yellow or mud-colored capsules\ncontain older embryos and larvae. Remove the capsules, by means of forceps, to\na of sea water. Tear open the capsules with a pair of needles to\nrelease the eggs. Discard empty capsules. Examine the eggs under the microscope\nto ascertain the stage. Dark-fielu illumination may be helpful. lt is best to\nmix several batches of young stages for slide-making.\nB.

Eggs are visible at the oviuucal opening (anterior meaian\npart of foot). After the egg is fastened to glass, the snail may be removed\ngently, ana the capsule transferrea to a watch glass of filtered sea water with a\npair uf fine forceps. Since snailsseem to prefer to deposit eggs on the woouen\nsiues of the tank, in preference to the glass, J. Oppenheimer suggests inserting\nsheets ef glass over these sides; these can be removed from the sides for\ninspection purposes without disturbing the animals.\nThe Opening of (The stage of uevelopment of the eggs may be determined\nbefore removal from the capsule with the aid of a binocular microscope.) When\nthe proper stage is found, pin sown the side of the capsule furthest from the eggs\nwith a dissecting needle. with another needle, tear off the section that is\npinned tu the dish, making sure that a very large tear is made. If gentle\npressure is now applied to the capsule, the eggs will flow out of the mass of\njelly. Make sure that all cf the eggs are free of the capsule and that the\ncapsule is rather well torn up before releasing the gressure, or else the thick\njelly will rush back into the capsule, carrying the eggs with it. All of the\noperations must be carried out under water, for the eggs rupture on contact with\nair. The jelly dissolves in the water, and after a few seconds, the eggs will\nsettle down to the bottom of the aish.\nQlgayggesz Approximate Time Table:\nlobe SO minutes (lst polar body coming off)\nDisaap. of lobe 59 minutes (lst polar bony off)\n2nd apsears 1 hr. 12 min.\nZno lobe LHS 2 hrs. 12 min.\nBra lobe 2 hrs. 42 min.\ncleavage 3 hrs. 42 min.\nA cells A hrs. 52 min.\nObserve later stages of development through the veliger larva\n(there is no trochophore larva.)\nREFERENCES\nClement, anthony C. 1935 The formation of giant polar bodies in centrifuged eggs\nof Ilyanassa.

In particular, we are interested\nin how these patterns directly reflect an underlying maternal\norganisation of the egg cytoplasm, and the extent that those\ncytoplasmic cues are mediated by a hierarchy of zygotically\nactive control genes. As probes for zygotic transcription,\nwe will use three transformant lines in which the structural\ngene for -galactosidase has been fused to various Drosophila\ncontrol sequences. All three lines were made by Yatsushi\nHiromi when he was in Walter Gehring\'s lab in Basel..\nIn one line the cis-acting control sequences\nare derived from the 5\' region of the segmentation gene fushi\ntarazu, This fusion causes -galactisidase to be expressed\nat the blastoderm stage in same seven stripe pattern\nassociated with the wild type gene. One major difference\nis that the protein is extremely unstable and is no\nlonger present by mid-gastrula stages. In contrast, -\ngalactosidase made at the blastodern stage persists through\nout embryogenesis, effectively marking the progeny of all\ncells whose precursors expressed the gene.\nThe other two constructs are artificial and the nature\nof the cis-acting control sequences is not understood. In\nboth cases, the galactoidase (fused to a non-spatially\ncontrolled promotor) has been stabily integrated at various\nrandom sites in the Drosophila genome. Ocassionally, the\nsite of insertion confers a tissue or region specific pattern\non the expression of galactosidase. It is not known whether\nthe pattern observed actually reflects the expression of a\nDrosophila gene in the vicinity on the insertion site. Be\nthat as it may, the transformant lines at least provide\nmarkers for particular embryonic lineages. In one\nthe expresion is apparently limited to the\nanterior and posterior midgut devivatives. In the\nit is expressed at a late stage in the\nmesodermal component of the gonad.\nTo study how the expression patterns of these constructs\nare affected by alterations in maternal cytoplasmic cues, we\nwill use three different maternal effect mutation.\n\n'),(336,3,'Embryology 1988_ 118.tiff.','1.) Females homozygous for BicaudalD produce embryos\nwhich lack anterior head and thoracic structures,\nforming instead two posterior abdomens in mirror image\nsymmetry. At gastrulation, posterior midgut\ninvaginations are observed at the anterior and posterior\nends of the egg. At room temperature the penetrance of\nthe phenotype is somewhat variable. Many embryos show\nno polarity reversals and only partial reductions in\nanterior structures.\n.2.) Females homozygous for tudor produce embryos which\ndo not make germline precursors (\"pole cells) and show\npattern deletions in their abdominal region.\nDevelopment at the anterior end of the egg in normal.\n3.) Females homozygous for concertina produce embryos\nwhich do not form a posterior midgut. Other\ngastrulation movements are initiated normally, but the\nembryo is soon thrown into multiple folds It is not\nknown whether the pole cells which are formed normally\nmake it into the interior of the embryo in the absence\nof a posterior midgut invaginations\nTo study the effect of early zygotically active genes on the\nexpression of -galactosidase in these transformants, we\nwill use mutations in two segemntation genes and one gene\ncontrolling morphogenetic movements at gastrulation.\n1.) In embryos homozygous for the \"gap\" mutation\nKruppel, pattern elements in the thorax and anterior\nabdomen are deleted and replaced by a mirror image\nduplication somewhat similar to that observed in embryos\nfrom Bicaudal mothers.\n2.)In embryos homozygous for the \"pair-rule\" mutation\nhairy, pattern elements in alternate segments are\ndeleted. The deletion consists of the posterior\nportions of the odd-numbered segments and the anterior\nregions of the even numbered segments.\n3.) In embryos homozygous for folded gastrulation,\nsegmentation is normal but the animal fails to form a\nposterior midgut at gastrulation. The appearance of\nembryos at gastrulation is identical to that of embryos\nfrom concertina mothers\nWe will discuss the results of these experiments as a group.\nMost likely you will not able to stain embryos from all the\ncrosses listed below, but you should try to get several done.\nFor the crosses that you do, you should also some embryos\nwhich have been allowed to develop for 24 hours in Hoyers\nMountant to determine the cuticle phenotypes.\n\n'),(337,3,'Embryology 1988_ 119.tiff.','w\' youareanallsingthe\nBicaudal mothers 43.03 males.\nCollect embryos as blastoderms, early gastrula (~3hrs after\neggs laid.)\n(Things to think about: Are only the anterior \n-stripes affected by the mutant?

General development of Ciona intestinalis\nCiona is probably the most universally distributed ascidian\nChordata, Urochordata (Tunicata), Class\nAscidiacea); it is also thought to be the most evolutionarily\nancient of the ascidians. Except for lack of genetics, it has\nmost of the advantages desired of an embryological model: large\nnumbers of developing zygotes, rapid development\ntime (see attached schedule), large relatively transparent cells\nand a lot of useful supportive data on experimental embryology and\nbiochemistry.\nThe attached materials from the Costello (1957) book will give\nbackground on the handling of this organism. The class should\nfirst do some fertilizations of eggs, and over the next 24 hr\nobserve microscopically the various stages of larval development.\nSome freshly hatched larvae have been provided to show you the\nlarval morphology and tissue organization.\n2. Demonstration of yellow crescent segregation in Styela\nclava eggs\nUnfortunately, Ciona does not have any natural cytoplasmic markers\nin the zygote, as do many of the species in the genus Styela. The\nclassic cell lineage (fate map) of Conklin \nassisted by observations of the segregation of a\n\"yellow crescent\" which forms subequatorially in the zygote a few\nminutes after fertilization. This crescent segregates into the\nmuscle cells of the developing larva, and aside from being an\nexcellent territorial and orientation marker for studying cell\nlineages it gives a potent visual demonstration that certain\nregions of egg (zygote) cytoplasm end up always in the same cells.\nAs early as 1905, Conklin and others deduced correctly that they\nwere watching an example of potential \"cytoplasmic control\" of\nsubsequent cellular differentiation, in this case of muscle.\nThe so-called crescent is actually a large aggregation of\nmitochondria, associated yolk granules and other cytoplasmic\nmaterials. They make up a distinctive myoplasmic domain; in some\nspecies the crescent region is colored because of differential\nattachment of yolk granules to the mitochondria. Although not\ndirectly visible in Ciona it can easily be demonstrated with\nmitochondrial stains of various kinds.\n\n'),(339,3,'Embryology 1988_ 120.tiff.','tudor mothers 152 males.\nCollect embryos as early and late gastrula (3-5 after\neggs laid)\n(Things to think about: Is staining exactly comparable\nto that observed in the otherwise 152 stock.\nDoes the absence of pole cells affect the size or\nmorphology of the posterior midgut?

Although the mutation is not well under-\nstood, the phenotype seems to arise from the reduced number of lipid droplets which\nare incorporated into the basal side of blastoderm cells during cellularization (W ieschaus\nand Sweeton, unpublished observations, see also Figures 4, 6 and 8).\n4. EMBRYONIC STAGES AND MORPHOLOGICAL CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFY-\nING APPROXIMATE AGES OF LIVING EMBRYOS\nThe staging system outlined below is primarily useful for work with living embryos\nin stages after blastoderm formation (stages 6- 16). Approximate timings at room\ntemperature are given in the parentheses following the stage designation. The\nnumbering of the stages and the morphological criteria for their identification are the\nsame as those suggested by Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein (3) in their monograph\non Drosophila development. except that those authors add a stage 17 corresponding\nto the final differentiated embryo.

The germ band appears compact and light. contrasting sharply\nwith inner. dark yolk. The earliest indications of a segmental pattern can sometimes\nbe observed as regularly spaced bulges of the dark interface between outer and inner\ncell layers of the germ band.

Three layers are discernible in the germ band. The\nembryo has retracted from the vitelline membrane at the posterior tip of the egg. The\nanterior midgut has flattened out and grown along the germ band, obscuring the dis-\ntinction between head and ventrally. The stomodeum is deep. The posterior midgut\nstretches along the dorsal side of the germ band and, due to neuralblast proliferation,\nthe dense yolky regions gradually disappear from the head.\n4.12 Stage 12: shortening of germ band (9 to 10 30 min)\nThe germ band contracts and becomes very compact, starting at the anterior end.

Frontal sac formation begins as the dorsal ridge moves anteriorly\ncovering the head region. The posterior midgut broadens dorsally. Ventral layers become\napparent and gradually flatten out along the yolk sac. The hindgut grows antero-dorsally\nforming a sharper angle with the midgut.

Subsequently constrictions divide the midgut into three regularly spac-\ned subdivisions.\n4.16 Stage 16: condensation of CNS (15 to the completion of embryonic development)\nThe major remaining morphogenetic movements are the condensation of the nervous\nsystem and the conversion of the initially sac-like gut into a long convoluted tube. As\nthe nervous system contracts along the ventral side of the embryo, the convoluting gut\nfills in the space between the posterior tip of the ventral nervous system and the anal\npads.

More\nrecently, they have been used to reveal remarkable, periodic post-fertilization\nwaves of still unknown function. In the ascidian egg, most of these start from\nthe vegetal pole.5\nThey have also been used to reveal an apparent steady standing gradignt of\nfree calcium with its high point at the vegetal pole of medaka fish eggs. In\nfucoid eggs, such a gradient--with the high calcium region at the future growth\nor rhizoid pole--has long been postulated to help establish the main develop-\nmental axis. Recent support for this hypothesis comes from the results of\nmicroinjecting various buffers.\nThe development of such \'baptized\' eggs is arrested for periods of up to\ntwo weeks. Moreover, the relative effectiveness of BAPTA buffers of different\ndissociation constants or KDS can be determined from the minimum buffer\nconcentration needed to arrest development. So far, the weaker the buffer, the\nless must be injected. Thus the newly 5,5\' \na KD of 70 UM--is about 100 times more effective than 5,5\' dimethyBAPTA which\nhas a KD of 0.4 UM. These results suggest that the needed calcium hot spot is\nat a remarkably high level--perhaps 100 uM or more.7\n1. Blinks, J.R. (1982) In Techniques in Cellular Physiology, P126: 1-38.\n2.

The animals are her-\nmaphroditic and, under some conditions at least, self-fertile (just, 1934a, 1934b).\nThey are oviparous.\nBREEDING SEASON \nAlmost any time of the year, since Ciona is sexually mature above a certain\nsize limit. Reproduction is seasonal only to the extent of the of the growth\ncycle (Berrill, 1937).\nPnocunmc AND HANDLING MATERIAL:\nA. Care of Adults: Mature adults will continue to produce normal eggs for\nseveral days in the laboratory, provided they are not crowded. Place only a few\ntogether in a large fingerbowl and insure a constant supply of fresh sea water.\nB. Procuring Gametes: The eggs are normally shed at daybreak, but Rose\n(1939), using Styela, has developed a method for postponing this until a more\nconvenient time. The adults are stored in a dark place, such as a desk drawer,\nuntil eggs are needed; shedding occurs almost immediately upon retum of the\nanimals to light.\nArtificial insemination in this species is highly successful, since the genital ducts\ncontain only ripe gametes. These may be obtained by slitting open the test and\npipetting the eggs and sperm from the oviduct and sperm duct, respectively. If\nnecessary, fine scissors can be used to puncture the ducts. The eggs remain viable\nfor 18 hours after removal. They should be passed through several changes of\nsea water before insemination, to free them of perivisceral Huid.\nC. Preparation of ultures: Naturally-spawned eggs should be collected with\na small-mouthed pipette and placed in lingerbowls of fresh sea water. The arti-\nFicially-obtained eggs should be inseminated with a sperm suspension sufficiently\nconcentrated to impart a faint milkiness to the sea water in which the eggs are\ncontained. Berrill (1937) routinely uses eggs and sperm from different individ-\nuals, which is a wise precaution even in this self-fertile species.

The pH 5.0 is neutralized by the addition of 14\ndrops of 1M Tris pH 8.0 from a long-form pasteur pipette per 50 ml. The eggs\nare allowed to settle and the water changed. An aliquot of the dejellied eggs\n(eggs should lie close together if jelly coat has been successfully removed)\nis then placed in 4 ml of in a siliconized, embryological watch-\nglass.\nSPERM COLLECTION: Male sea urchins are injected with about 1 ml of 0.5 \nKCI.

The timing\nis critical: Too short a period and the eggs stick poorly, too long and the\neggs are unable to undergo normal elevation of the vitelline membrane on\nfertilization. The hardened fertilization membrane restricts subsequent\ncleavage.\nFollowing protamine coating, dishes are washed with distilled water to\nremove unadhered protamine sulfate solution, and air dried.

The protamine\nsulfate solution may be reused several times, if kept in the refrigerator.\nMICROINJECTION NEEDLE PREPARATION: Needles for microinjection are prepared\nfrom 1.0 mm outside diameter, 0.75 mm inside diameter, borosilicate, omega dot\n(Q) glass supplied by Frederick Haer and Co., Brunswick, Maine (No. 30-30-\n0). It is essential that the glass is thoroughly cleaned by placing in a hot,\n35% nitric acid solution for 1 hr, washing through several times with\ndistilled, water, and finally distilled. water filtered 0.2 mn through. a\n\"Gelman\" filter.

The injection solution is\ntaken to the tip by the capillary of the tube. Filling in this way\nminimizes the risk of picking up any fine particulate matter lodged in the\nneedle.  The needle is then mounted in the right-needle holder (right-handed\npeople). \'This is connected by plastic tubing to a 2 ml Hamilton glass barrel\nsyringe. Again the entire apparatus is entirely filled with mineral oil. The\nsyringe should be set one turn before maximum capacity for appropriate control\nof ejection. Large pressures can be exerted on the injection solution, or\nnegative pressure may be applied as inserting the needle into the apparatus\nitself places pressure on the injection fluid. A \"breaking pipette\" is made\nby passing an empty injection needle through a nsen flame.

The condenser is focused and light. source centered (see Leitz\nmanual). The breaking pipette is then brought into focus just above the eggs\nand the injection needle brought into sharp focus next to the breaking\npipette.

The needle is\nthen lowered using the fine adjustment onto the egg so that the egg surface is\nindented. The needle is then quickly but smoothly pushed forward into the egg\nusing the joystick control. A clear area of cytoplasm will arise at the point\nof injection which will be towards the left one-half to one-third of the\negg. The needle is then immediately removed quickly but smoothly out of the\negg. The operation is repeated for the next egg in line.\nThe flow from the needle is critical for successful injection.

The diatom is used as a basic food, and\nits culture, within the bell jar, is regulated by controlling the amount of light with\na dark paper shield. Nutrient salts are added from time to time.\nD. Removal of the horion: Berrill (1932, 1937) gives several methods for the\nremoval of the chorion for experimental purposes; this technique involves the use\nof crab stomach juice or proteolytic enzymes. Berg (1956) digested the chorion\noff unfertilized eggs with a 3% solution of protease in sea water. For observation,\nthe chorion may be removed by simply rolling the eggs under a coverslip (Conklin,\n1905).\nNonzuar. Dsvanormaurz\nA. The Unfertilized Ozmm: The diameter of this egg is between 150 and 170\nmicrons, according to Conklin (1905) and Berrill (1935). The egg is surrounded\nby a chorion, and inner and outer layers of follicle cells, the latter being elongated\nand pyramidal in shape (Berrill, 1929). There is a perivitelline space (Conklin,\n1905). The egg has a clear, transparent cortical layer, and either green or red\npigment in the yolk granules; the former color indicates a physiologically young\negg, the latter a physiologically old one (Berrill, 1929). The o6cyte proceeds to\nthe metaphase of the first maturation division when it enters the oviduct, and is\nshed into the water at this stage.\nB. Fertilizatian and Cleavage: Although possible, self-fertilization is not at all\ncommon in Ciona. Following insemination, two polar bodies are extruded. They\nare larger than the inner follicle cells and remain attached to, or embedded in, the\negg, thus constituting an important landmark. The lirst two cleavages are equal\nand divide the egg into future right and left halves,\nBerg (1956) isolated Ciona blastomeres at the four-cell stage, and by spectro-\nphotometric methods demonstrated that the cytochrome oxidase activity of pos-\nterior blastomeres is about 2.7 times that of anterior blastomeres. He interprets\nhis results to indicate a localization of mitochondria in the posterior blastomeres.\nGastrulation is by invagination and epiboly (Castle, 1896). (For further de~\ntails of development, consult the papers by Conklin, 1905, and Duesberg, 1915.)\nC. Rate of De\'velopment: Duesberg (1915) states that cleavage begins one\nhour after insemination, and that hatching occurs at 19 hours, whereas Conklin\n(1905) reported that the latter event took place 12 hours after insemination; the\ntemperature was not recorded in these papers. At 16? C., hatching occurs at about\n25 hours, according to Berrill (1935). He also noted gastrulation at 7 hours,\nclosure of the blastopore at 11 hours, and the appearance of sensory pigment 19\nhours after insemination at \nD. Later Stages of Development and Meta~morpho.vis.? The tadpole, which\nhatches by means of a proteolytic enzyme (Berrill, 1932), is urodele-like in ap-\npearance. lt has vertical tail fins, three adhesive papillae for attachment, a sensory\nvesicle with both a statocyst and a light~sensitive organ, and a short intestine.\nThe siphons are not prominent.

At metamorphosis the tail is resorbed and the mouth and\natrial siphons rotate to a dorsal position. A heart and two primary gill slits\nappear soon after attachment. The affixed anterior region of the tadpole grows\nout to form a stalk which lifts the trunk away from the substrate.

It is brownish or yellow in colorlength. Occasionally, the animals are found in groups although,\nas noted above, the form is not a colonial one. They are quite common around\nWoods Hole, Mass.\nBREEDING \njune to September, according to Berrill (1937).\nPROCURING AND HANDLING \nA. Care of Adults: The animals live well in the laboratory, if they are ade-\nquately supplied with sea water. High temperatures should be avoided., \nB. Procuring Gametes: Although it is hermaphroditic, Styela is ordinarily\nself-sterile. Eggs and sperm are shed between 4 and 7 P.M., and fertilization takes\nplace when the ripe gametes from two different individuals are mixed. The usual\nmethod of obtaining Styela eggs and embryos has been to mince the gonads from\na large number of individuals, in a dish of sea water. This liberates all stages in\nthe maturation of eggs and sperm, and usually at least a few eggs will be fertilized\n(whatever the time of day or night) and will begin normal development.\nRose (1939) has described a method of controlling natural spawning in the\nlaboratory; it works-well except for a few weeks in mid-summer, when the animals\nare spent. The adults are kept in the dark until eleven or twelve hours before\nfertilization is desired; then an artificial day is started, by turning on a 40-watt\nelectric light, placed about 18 inches from the animals. Eggs and sperm are dis-\ncharged in clouds at the desired time. The same batch of animals can be induced\nto shed a number of times on successive days.\nNORMAL DEVELOPMENT \nA. The nfertilised Ot\'um.? The mature unfertilized egg is approximately 150\nmicrons in diameter, and has a tough membrane, the chorion, to which a few follicle\ncells adhere at the outer surface. Between the chorion and the egg surface, there\nare small, spherical inner follicle cells (\"nurse cells\"), which contain yellow\ngranules. The peripheral layer of the egg is clear and contains minute yellow\ngranules, and the central part of the egg consists of grey yolk platelets. The\ngerminal vesicle is large and clear, and is excentrically placed, near the animal\npole; it ruptures and maturation begins at about the time when the eggs are\ndischarged. The maturation spindle remains at the metaphase of the first division\nuntil the sperm enters.\n221\n\n'),(383,3,'Embryology 1988_ 19.tiff.','222 STYELA\nB. Post-Fertilisation Changes: The sperm enters at or near the vegetal pole\n(Conklin, l905a) maturation continues, and two polar bodies are given off. An\nextensive re-arrangement of the cytoplasm now occurs: within two to eight minutes\nafter fertilization, the clear, yellowish peripheral material streams to the lower\npole, over the yolk, followed by the clear protoplasm from the animal pole. This\nprocess is best studied using daylight for illumination; the microscope diaphragm\nshould be open as far as possible.\nThe grey yolk rises to occupy the upper pole, except for the space which sur-\nrounds the maturation spindle. Soon the yellow substance accumulates on one\npart of the lower hemisphere, where it assumes a crescentic form. Immediately\nabove the broad part of the yellow crescent, there is a layer formed by the clear\ncytoplasm.\nThe pigmented regions of the egg correspond closely to the various\nembryonic areas with specific presumptive developmental fates. The yellow pig-\nment area, at the posterior vegetal region, forms the \"yellow crescent,\" which is\npresumptive mesoderm. The ventral and anterior portion of the vegetal hemi-\nsphere, which has the slate grey color of the yolk, forms endoderm and small\namounts of mesoderm; it also contributes to a portion of the neural plate. The\nanimal hemisphere material, which is light grey in color because of the presence\nof clear protoplasm beneath the peripheral yolk, forms the body epidermis and a\nportion of the neural plate. The animal pole becomes the ventral-anterior side  of\nthe larva, while- the vegetal pole is the future dorsal side.\nC. Cleavage and Gastrulation: The tirst cleavage is equal, separating the two\n\"horns\" of the yellow crescent from one another and bisecting the clear protoplasm\nanterior to the yellow region- The second cleavage is nearly equal, vertiml, and\nat right angles to the first. The two posterior cells contain only a small amount of\nyolk and practically all the yellow crescent substance. The two anterior cells, on\nthetother hand, contain much yolk and almost no yellow crescent material. There\nis an equal division owe clear protoplasm to the four cells. At the third cleavage,\nwhich is horizontal, the yellow crescent substance is almost entirely confined to\nthe two posterior dorsal cells. The planes of cleavage at the fourth division vary\nin different quadrants, but the cells do not overlap the sagittal plane of the embryo.\nTwo of the antero-dorsal cells and two of the postero-ventral cells of the 16-cell\nembryo are crowded away from this sagittal plane, but all the other cells touch it.\nThe dorsal and ventral hemispheres at this stage are mirror images of one another.\nThe yellow pigment lies in four posterior cells. Division in the dorsal (vegetal)\nhemisphere precedes that in the ventral (animal) hemisphere at the fifth cleavage,\nand cleavage in the anterior part of each hemisphere precedes that in the posterior\npart. Vi/hen the 32-cell stage is reached, the yellow substance is almost entirely\nconfined to six dorso-posterior cells, three on each side of the midline. They give\nrise to mesoderm and Six yolk-filled cells at the vegetal pole,\nanterior to the yellow mesoderm cells, give rise to endoderm. Four cells at the\nanterior border of the embryo (just below the equator) and two just above the\nequator produce the notochord and neural plate. All the other cells are ectodermal.\nGastrulation is by epiboly. The gastrula passes through disc-shaped, saucer-\nshaped and cup-shaped stages, starting at the seventh cleavage.

The p-formaldehyde solution should be relatively fresh\n(not more than a month old) and adjusted to neutral pH at the time\nof its preparation to prevent breakdown to methanol.\nFixation in the p-form is for a period 15-30 min at SOC on ice.\nThere are some situations in which 80% ethanol works better as a\nfixative, especially whereo the species has a thick larval test.\nFixation After fixation, rinse once in Reaction Medium then incubate in\nReaction Medium for 30-90 min at Reaction Medium\ncontains the substrate bromochloroindolyl phosphate and the\nelectron (hydrogen) acceptor Nitro*BT.\nThe localized reaction of alkaline phosphatase appears first as a\nfaint chartreuse-blue color; as the enzyme continues to react, the\nproduct deepens in color to a darker blue. Since AlkP is a minor\ncomponent of all tissues, with longer incubation times the\nbackground reaction in other tissues will eventually deepen and\nserve to obscure any differential staining.\nwhen ethanol is used as a fixative, the tissues are rendered\nsomewhat more permeable to reagents, and a sufficient differential\nstaining reaction may occur within 10-15 min.\nThe reaction is stopped by moving the specimens to 352 ethanol\nwhere the color will deepen but remain stable for several days.\nAs soon as possible, samples should be run up rapidly through a\ngraded series of alcohol concentrations to xylene and mounted in\ndam ar or balsam resin. If left in absolute ethanol the tissues\ngradually destain; they ldestain overnight in xylene. After\nspecimens are mounted in resin the stain seems to be permanent.\nReagents and Solutions:\n1. 25% p-formaldehyde Solution\n25 para-formalgehyde in 100 ml distilled water dissolved\nby heating to 60 and adding 1N dropwise until soln\nclears.

The major source of hydrogens is\nprobably from the formation of the dehydroindigo. Diformazan is\nsaid to be insoluble in alcohols and when mounted in a\nxylene-soluble resinous medium remains a permanent color. In my\nown experience the blue diformazan color disappears slowly in\nalcohols; either the product is soluble or the alcohols\nprovide slight reducing conditions.

Since spawning in sea\nurchins is often epidemic any spawning individual should be removed immediately from\nthe Collection or storage containers.\ni Determination of the Sex\nThe sea urchins are dioecious and the two sexes of most species cannot be\ndistinguished by external examination. Therefore, sexes must be determined by\nexamination of the gonads or gametes (see below). On rare occasions an hermaphrodite\nsea urchin may be found.\nTemperature\nThe seasonal variation of surface water temperature is, of course, locale-\ndependent. In general, handling of eggs and embryos should be done at sea water table\ntemperatures. Strongylacentrotus purpuratus should be handled at ~l5?C.\nSpawning Induction\nTwo methods are in general use. The method of choice will vary depending upon\nthe amount of gametes required and the purpose for which they are intended.\nMethod l: This depends upon the fact that isotonic KCI (0.5 M) causes contraction of the\nmuscles of the gonads, with consequent shedding of gametes through the duct system.\nDraw up about 0.75-1.0 ml of KCI in a syringe and inject into the perivisceral cavity\nthrough the peristomeal membranes. Inject in two or three sites, 0.25-0.5 ml to a site.\nQuickly invert females over a beaker of clean Millipore filtered sea water (MFSW) to\ncollect eggs. (NCTE: The filters should be first rinsed with distilled water to remove\nthe detergent used as a wetting agent.) The eggs should not be permitted to come into\ncontact with air. Collect sperm \"dry\", without dilution, as extruded, using a Pasteur\npipette. Fertilizable life of sperm of echinoderms decreases as semen is diluted with sea\nwater. Transfer sperm to a test tube on ice.\nMethod 2: Sea urchins are induced to shed by electrical stimulation. The effectiveness\nof the method varies with the species. Arbacia and S. purpuratus respond readily.\nLytechinus, poorly. Place electrodes (from 10-25 A.C. source) on the test of the sea\nurchin in the aboral ectoderm region. In 0.5-l minute gametes will flow from the\nonadopores and may be drawn up in a pipette. The animal may be exposed to air\ngpreferable for males) (Cautionl Lytechinus are very susceptible to drying in air and\nshould be kept wet) or emersed in sea water (females) during this procedure. This is the\nmethod of choice for routine sexing or when a small amount of material is needed, for\nthe animals shed only while the current is passing through them.\nEHD:Franks2 (6/9/88)\n\n'),(394,3,'Embryology 1988_ 29.tiff.','Sea Urchin Egg Morphology \nShed eggs from good ripe females are generally ready for fertilization. Both\nmaturation divisions have occurred in the ovary and the polar bodies are generally lost.\nLytechinus variegatus is unusual. In this form, the polar bodies regularly remain\nattached to the egg surface. Egg suspensions from some females may contain immature\neggs. These are easily recognized by their large primary oocyte nuclei (germinal\nvesicle). Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs are approximately 80 microns in diameter.\nThey are surrounded by a jelly coat, made of large sulfated glycoproteins, which has the\nsame refractive index as water and therefore is invisible. With their jelly coats intact,\nthe eggs form a regular lattice work in a monolayer.\nInsemination\nBest results are obtained with good fresh eggs and sperm. Such material under\nproper conditions should give nearly 10096 fertilized eggs. Filter egg suspension through\nseveral layers of gauze or cheesecloth. Wash eggs at least once in MFSW just before\nfertilizing them by letting them settle and aspirating off the FSW, replacing it with fresh\nMFSW. \"Dry\" sperm should be diluted in FSW just before insemination. Sperm\nconcentration should be kept low to reduce chances of polyspermy. Excess sperm will\nalso contribute to contamination of cultures. Dilute about one of sperm in 20 ml\nMFSW and add to about 250 ml of egg suspension containing ~lO eggs (10 ml packed\neggs). Fertilized eggs, identified by their elevated fertilization membranes, should be\nwashed several times by repeated settling and aspiration, as above, to remove excess\nsperm.\nEmbryonic and Larval Cultures\nEmbryonic and larval stages should be maintained in FSW with regular changes.\nExcess sperm, immature eggs, egg fragments, and unfertilized eggs will support bacterial\ngrowth and subsequent ciliate contamination of cultures. In cases where immature or\nunfertilized material is present in quantity, healthy embryos can be separated by gently\ndecanting the culture into a partially immersed chamber whose bottom is formed by\nNitex screen of a mesh size small enough to retain the embryos but large enough to\npermit the eggs and egg fragments to pass through. Gentle agitation of the chamber will\nconcentrate the embryos without excessive damage. They can then be washed with sea\nWater.\nBacterial contamination can be more rigorously reduced in early embryonic\ncultures by the addition of penicillin (20 u/liter) and streptomycin (50 ug/liter)\nPenicillin/streptomycin stock \'solutions may be made up at l000X concentrates in MFSW\nand frpzen in small aliquots at Embryonic cultures should not exceed\n/liter FSW (l-296 by volume) and should be provided with a continuously stirring\nmechanism a motor-driven paddle working at -30-60 RPM). The stirring keeps the\nembryos from accumulating on the bottom or at the surface film and the culture\ndevelops more evenly. Large cultures should be provided with an air source an air\nstone or compressed air). As the embryos grow and begin to feed, cultures should be kept\nmore dilute and the MFSW (without antibiotics, which are detrimental to food sources)\nchanged more frequently. Larval rearing will not be addressed here.\nCollecting Embryos and Larvae from Cultures\nEggs and embryos can be collected by settling or gentle centrifugation. Once\nconcentrated, they should be immediately resuspended or prepared for experimental\n\n'),(395,3,'Embryology 1988_ 3.tiff.','MATRANGA, Valeria\nIstituto di Biologia dello Sviluppo\ndel C.N.R.\nvia Archirafi 20\n90123 Palermo\nItaly\n039-91-6162632.\nMAYOR, Roberto A.\n(University of Chile)\nAbel Gonzalez 0349\nSantiage 14\nChile\n557890\nPECULIS, Brenda Ann\nDepartment of Biology\nJohns Hopkins University\nBaltimore, Mm 21218\n(301) 467-1414\nPESAVENTO, Patricia A.\nDepartment of Cell and Developmental\nBiology\nHarvard University\nCambridge, MA 02139\nRICHARDSON, Wendy L.\nDepartment of Cell Biology\nBaylor College of Medicine\nHouston, TX 77030\nSMITH, Susan M.\nDepartment of Biology\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute\nTroy, NY 12180\n(518) 271-1831\nTANAKA Elly . 4\nAL\nSan Franciico, CA 94143 \n(415) 661-9212\nTILLINGHAST, Henry S.\nDepartment of Biology\nU.S. Air Force Academy\nColorado Springs, C0 80840\n(719) 574-0934\nWATSON, Kellie L. \nDevelop ental Biology Center\nDepartment of Developmental and\nCellular Biology\nUniversity of California\nIrvine, CA 92717\n(714) 548-3514\nWICKRAMASINGHE, Dineli M.\nTufts University\n136 Harrison Avenue\nBoston, MA 02111\n(617) 956-6692\nZAHNER, Joseph E.\nBiology Department\nJohns Hopkins University\nBaltimore, MD 21218\n(301) 338-8760\nInstructors:\nEric H.

The\nprotocol as outlined is adopted from several sources (references listed below), and it\nshould be noted that optimal times for glycine-EDTA treatment will vary with species of\nurchin (McClay and Marchose, 1979).\nThe Strongylocentrotus purpuratus pluteus larvae that we utilize here are at\n65 72 hr of development. The method works as well for earlier embryonic stages (Harkey\nand Whitely, l980).\nWash plutei several times by gentle centrifugation and resuspension in ice-cold\nMFSW.\nlr\nWash the final pluteus pellet very briefly by resuspension in 4-5 vol ice-cold\nglycine-EDTA, followed by centrifugation. Immediately aspirate off (pour off) the\nsupernatant (discard).\nResuspend the pellet in 4-5 vol glycine-EDTA. NOTE: For species that are\nparticularly susceptible to dissociation in glycine-EDTA, omit Step2 and use\n40 vol glycine-EDTA in Step 3. \nlncubate on ice for 4 min.\nSediment the plutei and quickly aspirate off the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in vol ice-cold NOTE: The plutei are not\ndissociated by the brief glycine-EDTA treatment which extracts hyalin. They\nshould be intact, the ectoderm cells remaining attached to the basal lamina lying\nbeneath the ectoderm layer, but should have a \"loose\" appearance that is due to the\nabsence of the hyalin layer.\nDissociate the plutei by pulling the suspension syringe (without a needle) 20 times or by pipetting up and down using a Pasteur\npipette. This removes the ectoderm cells and leaves the basal lamina as an intact\n\"bag\" covering the skeleton and endoderm. NOTE: After the plutei are removed\nfrom glycine and resuspended in dissociation should be begun within several\nminutes, as they become increasingly difficult to dissociate with longer delays due\nto regeneration of the hyalin layer.\nSediment the bags out of the plutei suspension. They pellet\nwith gentle centrifugation, for example, 20 sec in a clinical tabletop centrifuge, or\nat 250><g for 1+ min (Harkey and Whitely, l980). Save the supernatant which\ncontains the ectoderm cells. Wash the bag pellet 2-3 times with FSW. Monitor the\nbag fraction until it is free of ectoderm cells.\nFilter the ectoderm supernatant through Nitex-28 um. The filtrate contains\nectoderm cells, and the retentate contains contaminating bags. Collect the\nectoderm cells by centrifuging the filtrate at 650><g for 10 min, and resuspend the\ncells in MFSW.\n\n'),(402,3,'Embryology 1988_ 36.tiff.','Alternate Steps 8 and 9:\n(Alternate). Filter the plutei suspension through Nitex-Z8 um.\nSave the filtrate that contains ectoderm cells. Collect the retentate which\ncontains the bags into MFSW. Sediment and wash the bag fraction until it is free of\ncontaminating ectoderm cells as described in Step 8 above. NOTE: This step\nresults in a purer bag fraction than Step 8 above that is easier to rid of\ncontaminating ectoderm cells, however, several bags are lost by sticking to the\nNitex.\n(Alternate). Sediment the ectoderm cells out of the filtrate (which should be free\nof bags) by centrifuging as described in Step 9 above and resuspend the cells in\nMFSW.\nPurification of Endoderm Cell Suspensions from Bag Fractions\nNOTE: The details for this procedure have not yet been worked out for S.\npurpuratus.\nBriefly (try l-2 min and 3-li min to determine optimal time), incubate purified bags\non ice in glycine-EDTA.\nSediment the bags as in Step 8 above, resuspend in and triturate as in\nStep 7. A\nFilter the suspension through Nitex-28 um. The filtrate should contain a mixture of\nmesoderm and remaining ectoderm cells. Discard.\nResuspend the retentate (intact endoderm) in glycine-EDTA and incubate aliquots\nfor 3, Ll, 8 minutes (to determine the optimal incubation time) on ice.\nSediment, resuspend in and triturate for a third time. Endoderm cells\nshould separate from each other and from the skeleton to give a suspension of\nendoderm cells.\nTest for Purity of Isolation\nTo assess the purity of the dissociations, the preparations may be examined for\nalkaline phosphatase activity. Endoderm cells have high levels of alkaline phosphatase\nactivity, and in situ histochemical staining for enzymatic activity is selective for these\ncells Intact embryos, bags, and purified ectoderm cells and endoderm cells should be\ntested.\nPlace cells or embryos in a shallow depression slide in several drops of MFSW.\nAdd several drops of 0.2596 naphthol-AS-MX phosphate (PH 8.6) to the suspension.\nAdd l-2 grains of the diazonium salt, fast blue RR. Naphthol AS-MX formed at\nsites of alkaline phosphatase activity produces an insoluble azo pigment. Optimum\nalkaline phosphatase activity should be observed in about 5 min.\nBased on the percent positive cells (frequency of dye deposits) observed\n(microscopically) in each, determine the purity of the ectoderm and endoderm\npreparations.\n\n'),(403,3,'Embryology 1988_ 37.tiff.','3\nPurity may also be checked by measuring the level of cross-contamination with\ntissue-specific present in RNA extracted from each cell preparation (next lab).\nSolutions:\n1.

Each of the\nactive genes (six known) of this family is regulated independently during development and\nfunctions in diverse cell lineages or sets of cell lineages at diverse stages of\ndevelopment. Transcripts of one gene, called M, are confined to muscle cells in adult sea\nurchins, and in the embryo to muscle anlage cells that differentiate after gastrulation.\nThe remaining five active actin genes are all expressed in non-muscle cell types, and\npresumably code for cytoskeletal actin proteins. One of these, is exclusively\nexpressed in the aboral ectoderm of plutei and in presumptive aboral ectoderm at\nblastula stage. Thus, the transcript is a specific molecular marker for the aboral\nectoderm cell lineage.\nThe endoskeletal spicules of the sea urchin embryo are elaborated by the primary\ncells, descendants of the micromeres, beginning at gastrulation, and\nincrease in size and complexity as the pluteus larva matures. The mineral component of\nthe skeletal structures is a 20:1 complex that is deposited within a\nprotein template secreted by the skeletogenic cells. The major component\nof the spicule matrix is a glycoprotein called SM50. The SM50 gene is expressed\nexclusively in the skeletogenic its transcripts appearing in primary\ncells even before the onset of skeletogenesis. The SM50 gene, then, is a\nmolecular marker for the skeletogenic cells.\nThe numbers of and SM50 transcript molecules that are accumulated in S.\npurpuratus embryos have been determined. In the 64-hr pluteus (~l800 cells) there are\nabout CylIIa molecules present, or 190 transcripts per aboral ectoderm\ncell (~l+70 cells total). The prevalence of SM50 is about 130 molecules per\nprimary cell (~60 cells total) in the 3-day pluteus. These measurements\nwere made using a single-stranded probe excess titration technique described by Lee\net al. (1986). ln this method total embryo RNA is mixed at 5/Qrious mass ratios with an\nexcess amount (with respect to the sequence of interest) of P-labeled single-stranded\nprobe (RNA in the experiments above), and reacted in solution to completion. The\namount of nuclease-resistant hybrids that form with the various amounts of\ntotal embryo RNA is then measured. From these determinations the prevalence of the\nin question may be calculated as follows:\nMass of xy/B6 where\n(cpm for 32P)/ug RNA slope of titration curve\ntotal RNA/embryo 2.8 ng\n3 probe specific activity (cpm)/ug probe\n5 fraction of contained in probe probe length/mRNA length\n.0028 ug RNA\nmass probe length embryo\nug probe length\nThe mass/embryo may then, of course, be converted to numbers of\ntranscripts/embryo (or cell), based on the known molecular weight (ug/transcript) of the\n\n\n'),(409,3,'Embryology 1988_ 42.tiff.','The accuracy of the probe excess titration measurement is limited only by the\nrecovery of the probe hybrids, the data scatter, and knowledge of the probe\nspecific activity.\nTitration of and SM50 Transcripts in Embryonic Cell Fractions\nWe will repeat the single-stranded probe excess titration experiments described\nabove, using RNA extracted from the ectoderm and bag preparations made in the\nprevious lab section. Each fraction should, of course, be enriched for either \ntranscripts (ectoderm) or transcripts of SM50 (bags) and, ideally, should contain one or\nthe other transcript.\nSince time is limited the RNA preparations and radiolabeled probes will be\nprovided to you. Two widely-used methods for isolating urchin embryo RNA are\navailable and are described in detail by Posakony et al. (1983) and Shott et al. (198l4).\nThe RNA probes were prepared from transcription vectors containing sequences\nrepresentB\'? either the transcript or the SM50 transcript. They were \nusing [oi- (800 Ci/mmole) and purified from unincorporated nucleotides by\nSephadex G-100 chromatography (ref: Promega Biotec).\n1.

Transfer it to sterile sea water in a small petri\ndish. A steel dissecting needle and a pair of fine scissors or a single edge razor blade\nwill be needed for opening the capsule. Using the low power of the dissecting microscope,\nhold one end of the capsule against the dish with the needle and remove the other end\nwith the scissors or razor blade. The eggs will be held in the capsule by The\njelly is soluble in sea water and will ultimately dissolve. The capsule should be allowed\nto sit for l0-15 minutes to allow the jelly to partially dissolve; the eggs can then be\nexpelled from the capsule by gently pressing it with a steel needle. Transfer the\nliberated eggs with a mouth pipette to a clean dish with sterile sea water.\nNormal Development: The fertilized uncleaved Tlyanassa egg is about l65 pm in diameter.\nlt is fertilized prior to laying. Shortly after the capsule is laid the first polar body\nis given off. As it is forming,the first polar lobe appears. This lobe is inconspicuous;\nthe only indication of its presence is a slight elongation along the animal-vegetal axis of\nthe egg, which gives the egg a top-like appearance. About 30 minutes (at 24 C.) after\nfirst polar lobe formation, second polar body formation takes place. A second polar lobe\nbegins to develop about 20 minutes prior to second polar body formation and continues to\nenlarge for some time after the second polar body is formed. The second polar lobe is\nvery broad and is more constricted from the rest of the cytoplasm than the first polar\nlobe. The third polar lobe begins to develop about 80 minutes after the second polar body.\nlt takes about 50 minutes from the beginning of third polar lobe formation to the trefoil\nstage when the polar lobe is maximagly constricted. This stage coincides with the end of\nthe first cleavage. This stage lasts for several minutes; then a short yolk-free stalk\ncan be seen connecting the lobe to one of the blastomeres. The stalk broadens as the\ncontents of the lobe flow into one blastomere. The resulting blastomeres are unequal in\nsize. The smaller blastomere is denominated AB, while the larger blastomere, CD}contains\nthe contents of the polar lobe. The fourth and final polar lobe appears in the vegetal\nregion of the CD cell as it undergoes its next division. The fourth polar lobe is the\nsame size as the third polar lobe. After the second cleavage is completed there are three\nsmall cells: and C, and a large cell, D, which contains the lobe substance.\nThe Ilyanassa embryo develops into a veligger larva. The veliger larva has a pigmented\noesophagus, stomach, and intestine. The velum bears large cilia and has a pigmented rim.\nShell, operculum, foot, eyes, otocyst and heart are easily seen by 5-6 days of development\n(see figure)\nExperiments: llyanassa embryos that are raised outside of the shell are subject to\nbacterial infections. This leads to embryonic death. In order to avoid infection it is\nnecessary to transfer embryos through several changes of sterile sea water to dilute out\nthe bacteria before manipulating them.\nl) Removal of the polar lobe: To remove the polar lobe at the trefoil stage, wait\nuntil the lobe is connected by only a slender thread of cytoplasm and is itself almost\nsperical.

When eggs which have just completed second polar body are centrifuged in a raffinose\nsolution (7g/25 ml water) the eggs are frequently separated into light nucleated animal\nfragments and heavy enucleated vegetal fragments. The centrifugation is done by slowly\nincreasing the centrifugal force to 2000g over a 3 minute period and then continuing to\ncentrifuge at this speed for an additional three minutes. This treatment does not always\nbring about fragmentation but in at least some cases the eggs are pulled into approximately\nequal parts. Immediately after centrifugation the light and heavy halves are washed in\nseveral changes of sterile sea water to dilute out the raffinose and the development of\nbothh?\\ves is monitored.\nReferences\nClement, A.

This animal exists as a colony which is composed of three kinds of individuals:\n1) feeding polyps, 2) stinging polyps and 3) reproductive polyps. The sexes are\nseparate in Hvdractinia; some colonies are male while others are female. Ripe\nfemales can be distinguished because the reproductive individuals have gonophores\nwith large opaque eggs while the males have \nGametes are obtained from these animals by spawnings. The timing of spawning\nis controlled by the light cycle. Normally the animals are maintained in a lab with\nthe light on at all times. Animals are prepared for spawning by putting them in the\ndark for 3-A hours. Spawning takes place about one hour after subsequent re-exposure\nto light. Generally the males and females are maintained in separate bowls and the\neggs are fertilized at will by adding or 2 drops of seawater from a male bowl to a\nculture of eggs. In oocytes the germinal vesicle breaks down soon after exposure to\nlight, the meiotic reduction divisions occur just before spawning.\nSpawned eggs are covered with a jelly coat which swells on exposure to sea water.\nFertilization of these eggs takes place at the site of polar body formation. The\negg produces a chemoatractant which causes the sperm to swim toward it. The first\ncleavage begins about one hour after fertilization. Cleavage is unipolar. Over the\nnext two days this embryo will transform into a ciliated non-feeding planula larva.\nThis larvae is radially sylnetrical. It has an ectodermal and an endodermal cell\nlayer. There are several cell tgnes in both tissue layers. After a larval period which\ncan be as short as two days the larvae settles and undergoes metamorphosis. During\nthe process of metamorphosis the larvae attaches at its anterior end and its posterior\nend transforms into the hydranth of the polyp.\ni \n4* \n4\n.\nLaboratory directionsj 4\n\nl) Watch the process of sperm chemotaxis and fertilization:\nCoat a siliclad treated slide with albumin. The albumin prevents the sperm from\nsticking to the slide and allows the sea water to form a large flat drop. Place or\n2 eggs in the drop, Find the eggs using your 10x objective (use dark feild illumination\nor stop your condensor down). Add sperm some distance from the eg; so that their\naeproach to the egg and subsequent behavior can be observed. (Note: you oi ht rant\nto an unfertilized een in dal? so that one half has the site of polar body formation\nand one half does not, and examine sperm behavior around each half.)\nZ)Mark parts of the early embryo so that the presumptive fate of different regions\ncan be traced:\nEarly embryos can be marked with a 1% solution of the dye nile blue which has\nbeen imobilized in agar in a micropipette. Nile blue A is made up as a 1% solution\nin distilled water. Agar is added and the solution is heated to dissolve the aiar.\nEnough agar is used anywhere between 2 and a lOl solution) so that when the solution\ncools gel will form.

The tube\nis held on the side of the dish with a bit of clay and a defined eg; region is moved\ninto contact with the dye. The egg should be kept in contact with the dye until it\nis visibly stained (1-5 minutes). Mark a number of eggs at the site of initiation\nof the first cleavage; follow these eggs to see where the mark is in the embryos at\nvarious developmental stages and in the planula. As an internal control, mark a\nset of eggs opposite the site of polar body formation.\n3) The induction of metamorphosis:\nMetamorphosis in Hydractinia is normally induced when the planula comes in\ncontact with certain marine bacteria (Muller, W. 1973). Metamorphsis can also be\ninduced in these animals by treating them with certain ions for a short period of\ntime; a pulse type application of caesium is especially effective in inducing meta-\nmorphosis. A solution containing 9.76 3 CsCl/ 100 nl distilled water is mixed with\nsea water to give a lzlo dilution. Three day old larvae are transferred to this\nmixture and incubated for 3 hours. The incubation medium is then replaced with\nnormal sea water (several changes).\nThis metamor hosis induction system can be used to ask a number of uestions:\n\n1) Are all parts of a nlanula competent to under netanor hosis? 2) What is the\nI 1 \ndevelopmental potential o; different planula parts? One way in which this problem\ncan be approached is by cutting planulae into anterior, middle and posterior thirds.\nEach third can then be treated with CaCl and the ability of each part to respond\nto the inductor by settling and the differentiation of the cases that settle can be\nscored.\nBibliography\nBallard, W. 1942 The mechanism for spawning in Hydractinia and Pennaria\nBiol.

CUTICLE PREPARATIONS\nrv 1 \n1. Following an egg collection, incubate embryos for 24 at 250C.\n2. Then remove chorion by gently rolling the eggs on \"double-stick\"\nscotch tape.\n3. Transfer embryos to a drop of Hoyer\'s Mounting Media (diluted with\nlactic acid, 1:1) and then apply a coverslip.\n4. Place slide ovemight on a warming plate.\nReferences:\nvan der Meer, J. (1977) Drosophila I nf, 52, 160.\nWieschaus, E., and Niisslein-Volhard, C. (1986) Looking at Embryos. \n a practical approach, D. B. Roberts IRL Press, Oxford, pp. 199-\n227. (see below).\nThe following procedures for making cuticle prepartions are all minor variants of the\noriginal technique described by van der Meer (24). The choice among procedures\ndepends on a balance between the desired quality of the preparation and the number\nof different stocks and embryos to be examined.\n5.1 Quick preparations of undechorionated eggs\nThis method may be used for determining hatch rates, embryonic phenotypes, etc.\nCollect embryos and allow them to develop until all nonnal individuals have\nhatched.\n(ii) Determine the number of hatched eggs by counting the empty chorions on the\nagar surface.\nPick the unhatched eggs from the plate with a forceps and transfer to a drop\nof Hoyer\'s mountant on a glass slide.\n(iv) Cover the drop with a small 10 mm) coverslip and incubate the preparation\novemight at \nithough the embryo is still covered by the chorion and some adherent yeast. it clears\n.te well and the chorion pattern, although still visible, often does not interfere with\nthe analysis of the cuticular phenotype. The major advantage of this procedure is that\nit is quick and no embryos are lost.\n5.2 Standard preparations in the vitelline membrane\nRemove the unhatched embryos from the plate with a small spatula or brush\nand transfer to a wire basket made from stainless steel mesh. When embryos\nfrom a number of stocks are to be processed at the same time, \'nets\' with pos-\nitions for seven stocks are convenient and time saving (see Section 7.2 for con-\nstruction of nets and baskets).\n(ii) Dechorionate the eggs by transfening the net or basket to sodium hypochlorite\n(commercial bleach, undiluted) in a 35-mm plastic Petri dish. The chorion has\nbeen removed when the shiny surface of the vitelline membrane is visible and\nthe eggs have become hydrophobic when removed and retumed to the bleach,\nthey float on the surface due to surface tension).\nRemove the net from the bleach, dry briefly on a paper towel, wash with a few\ndrops of water and retum to the emptied 35-mm Petri dish.\n(iv) Add sufficient glycerinezacetic acid (l fixative to the dish to cover the eggs\nbut not enough to cause them to float up out of the basket.\nCover the Petri dish. place it inside a larger Petri dish to reduce evaporation,\nand incubate for at \n(vi) Remove the dish from the oven and allow it to cool to room temperature.\nTransfer the basket to a paper towel to remove excess fixative.\nScoop the eggs from the individual positions using a fute-tipped brush and transfer\nthem to a drop of Hoyer\'s mountant on a glass slide.\n(ix) Cover them with a 10-mm or 18-mm coverslip and incubate at until the\nintemal tissue clears (generally ovemight).\n\n(vii)\n\nTo obtain better resolution \'pop` the vitelline membrane by pressing on the coverslip\nafter the embryos have cleared but before the Hoyer\'s mountant becomes too hard.\nThis is best done under a stereomicroscope. Retum the preparations to the oven to harden\nflatten by wrapping them in aluminium foil and placing two or three weights\non the coverslip for 3 days. This procedure yields preparations of very high quality,\nbut it is cmcial that the preparation has cleared before the weights are added.\n5.3 Embryos removed from their vitelline membranes\nThe greatest resolution of detail and the mos photogenic preparations are obtained when\nthe embryos are removed from the vitelline membrane prior to embedding. \'l\'he following\nprocedure is particularly useful when all of the progeny from a cross must be examin-\ned regardless of whether or not they hatch.\nCollect embryos at l2 intervals and allow them to develop an additional 6 \nat Dechorionate in a stainless steel net in bleach and transfer to a plastic\nPetri dish by inverting the net over the dish and gently squirting water through\nthe net. If the chorion has been completely removed the vitelline membrane will\nPetridish.\n(ii) Retum the Petri dish with the embryos still under water to for another\nI8 -24 to allow all embryos to complete embryonic development. First instar\nlarvae that hatch remain in the water and eventually drown. After 24 h, remove\nthe vitelline membrane from embryos that do not hatch using a fine tungsten\nor glass needle.\nincubate larvae and hatched embryos in water for 30 min at before fix-\nation, remove the water and add 1:4 glycerinezacetic acid. Fix larvae in this sol-\nution for l5-60 min at Best results are obtained when preparations are\nallowed to continue fixation at room temperature for at least 24 in the glycerine;\nacetic acid.\n(iv) Transfer the larvae individually to I-loyer\'s solution on a slide using a drawn\nout mouth pipette or brush.\nAdd coverslips of the desired size and allow the preparations to clear at \ntypically for 24 although they can usually be scored much earlier.\n5.4 Other tricks for especially llat preparations of high contrast\nWhen the coverslip is added, capillary action pulls the Hoyer\'s solution out over the\nentire area covered. If exactly enough Hoyer\'s is used, this causes the embryo to flatten\ngently under the coverslip without bursting. The Hoyer\'s mountant should not be too\nviscous. Mount the embryos rapidly to prevent the I-loyer\'s from drying out on the\nslide before the coverslip is added. Hoyer\'s which is too thick can be diluted with a\nfew drops of water. Peeled embryos can also be flattened with weights following the\nprocedures outlined in Section 5.2. lt is cmcial that the embryos first clear in the moun-\ntant for several hours at before adding the weights.\nFor higher contrast, dilute the Hoyer\'s mountant 1:1 with lactic acid. Clearing time\nis then reduced to at This procedure yields high contrast preparations par-\nticularly useful when the dorsal hair patterns must be analysed in detail. Unfortunate-\nly, the preparations tend to develop \n5.5 Analysis of cuticle patterm .\nExamine cuticle preparations using a compound microscope equipped with objectives\nfor both dark field and phase contrast optics. As a simple substitute for true dark field\noptics use low power objectives with the condenser in the phase contrast position (6.3\nobjectives with the condenser set at Ph 2; 10X or l6>< with the condenser in the Ph\n3 position). Useful landmarks and aensilla in the external cuticle (25) and head (26.27)\nare shown in Figures I0 and 11.\n5.6 Photographing cuticle preparations\nA high contrast film such as Kodak Technical Pan Film is most useful for photographing\ndetails of the dorsal hair and denticle pattem as observed in phase contrast optics. For\ndark field pictures of whole embryos, a lower contrast film like Kodak Panatomic-X\ngives the best detail, although when using an automatic exposure meter the DIN setting\nshould be set higher than recommended, i.e. 23 rather than l6.\n\n'),(468,3,'Embryology 1988_ 96.tiff.','From \"Drosophi1a, a practical approach\", pg. 217ProAl-1   \n\n\nt.   -ll -vw \n   \".211\n.7.71. -is\n5 45 \nCain atai Figure l0.
